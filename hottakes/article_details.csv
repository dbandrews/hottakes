Gee is conscious and we hope that the unconfirmed reports of him being able to move his toes on the stretcher are a positive sign. Gee's drop has been highlighted by competitors as especially difficult and terrifying. It was quite windy when he sent it this morning, most other riders weren't planning on riding at the time. He hit the drop with a lot of speed, drifting a bit back seat and to the right in the air, and landing deep before crashing.We are gutted for Gee, who has been fighting to recover from a crash in 2021 that left him with multitude broken bones and other injuries. Healing vibes to Gee, and we'll update this as we get more information.Update 4pm: Gee's posted his crash on Instagram with the caption ""Heavy day at RedBull Rampage, this one was always going to be a beast. #lightweightbaby. Injury update to follow.""        link=""https://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Gee Atherton (@gee_atherton) 

","Damn, this guy is always pushing himself so hard.  He comes back after insane crashes so good, his mental game is insanely strong.  I love watching Gee ride but won't be too crushed if he ""retires"", seeing him get injured this much is tough.Hoping for a good and speedy recovery for Gee, we know he'll put in the work to be right back where he was."

Deservedly on the latter end of that spectrum is Kyle Strait's Vitus VT-01, with a paint job befitting the Rampage regular and two-time winner. The bike's look was designed by Vitus' graphic designer Steven Mooney, and was brought to life by pro painter Jake Wilkins. Inspired by the Western Americana glitz and glam of the Nudie suit - the one-off statement pieces worn by midcentury country stars - this VT-01 sports some beautiful and unique finishing work.In addition to being a custom paint job, this is also the first prototype in Vitus' Gravity Project, meant to steer the direction of the brand in the years to come. A pretty intense proving ground, but I guess that's a good way to prove the bike's muster. Vitus has been pretty open about the development process, which you can learn more about here.

But Bellingham-bred Talus Turk is no rookie when it comes to freeride. The 21-year-old has spent the last few years proving himself in the bike world with appearances at Proving Grounds, Freeride Fiesta, and the Cam Zink Invitational. Only two days into riding, Turk has already spent time checking off features on his line including a massive step down drop on the upper half of the mountain.A big part of showing up ready to ride as a rookie at the biggest event in freeride is the bike you show up with. Supported by Bellingham-based Transition Bikes, Talus’ custom TR11 boasts not only a Rampage-ready build but a stunning paint job. Decorated with black, red, and gold cherry blossoms, Turk’s bike pays homage to his Japanese paternal heritage. Turk’s grandmother was a survivor of the WWII atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki by the US. As his last living grandparent, Turk wanted her to have the final say on the paint job for his first Rampage bike. Made Rad by Tony, a Bellingham based artist who specializes in custom bike painting brought Turk and his grandmother’s vision to life. Turk’s helmet has been painted gold with cherry blossoms to match the bike as well.For those curious about the rookie’s full setup, Turk is running a size medium alloy TR11. He’s running a RaceFace Atlas wheelset with Delium tires. A Marzocchi Bomber Shock and Bomber 58 Fork are keeping his bike nice and squishy. Tenet Components Omen V2 Pedals and Bodem C V2 bars round out Turk’s bike with more Bellingham pride. TRP DH-R Evo brakes keep the speeds in check, thanks in part to the massive rotors he's running front and back. The Reverse Components singlespeed setup keeps things simple, and makes for a cleaner cockpit to grab mid-air. Best of luck to Talus as he gets his lines dialed and prepares for the big show.            

","Gorgeous!

I absolutely love the simplistic beauty of Japanese art, and there culture is very interesting, and of course their incredible commitment to aesthetics and craftsmanship."

He's no stranger to going big in the desert, with multiple Rampage appearances under his belt and countless hours spent going big in the Utah desert. This year he'll be aboard a custom Nukeproof Dissent downhill bike with a paint scheme inspired by his favorite hip-hop groups Flatbush Zombies, $uicideboy$, and Mac Miller. All this music is relatable to me. It goes really hard. I've been listening to those guys the last 8-10 years and it just brings up really good memories. This bike is absolutely amazing and it means so much to me. I can't wait to hang it on my wall.— DJ Brandt It's the paint job that really makes this Dissent stand out. Otherwise, the build kit is typical of what you'd expect to find on a bike designed for sending, with aluminum bars and cranks, Shimano Saint brakes and drivetrain, and an air-sprung Marzocchi fork and shock.Design: Ryan McCann (Nukeproof) / Paint: Jonathan Bradley at Elite RefinishPhotos by Trevor Lyden

6,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/first-ride-transition-repeater-with-sram-powertrain.html,First Ride: Transition Repeater Powertrain eMTB - Pinkbike,The new Repeater gets more travel and a new motor.," Transition may have been a relative latecomer to the eMTB party, but after the launch of the full-power Repeater last year it wasn't long before they launched the lighter weight Relay. Now, the Repeater 2.0 is being launched, with  170mm of travel, and SRAM's new Powertrain motor with a 720 Wh battery. It still rolls on 29” wheels front and rear for all models, but a flip chip at the lower shock mount can be used to maintain the geometry for riders that prefer a 27.5” rear wheel.There are two versions for now, the Repeater X0 AXS ($11,999 USD) and the Repeater GX AXS ($10,499). It sounds like the original Repeater will still remain in the lineup, at least for the near future, to ever-so-slightly balance out the high price of the Powertrain equipped models.Repeater Powertrain Details• SRAM Powertrain motor, 720 Wh battery• 170 mm travel front & rear• Carbon frame• 29"" wheels (mixed wheel compatible)• Sizes: S-XL• Weight (size M): GX - 52.9 lb (24 kg) | X0 - 52.8 lb (23.9 kg)• Price: $10,499 - $11,999 USD• transitionbikes.comFrame & MotorProps go to Transition for stepping back from the thru-headset cable routing found on the original Repeater. Mistakes happen, and that design choice was one of them, so it's great to see that ports in the side of the frame have returned, which should increase headset bearing longevity and slightly reduce the number of annoyed mechanics in the world.  The general frame layout hasn't changed much – it still uses a Horst link layout with a vertical, trunnion mounted shock, which leaves plenty of room for a full size water bottle, at least on the larger sizes. Along with accessory mounts on the underside of the top tube, all of the Repeater Powertrains come with OneUp's handy EDC took stashed in the steerer tube. Both Repeater Powertrains models use a SRAM Transmission drivetrain, a combo that allows riders to have the system shift automatically. It's still not a feature that I'm sold on, since shifting isn't a task that I find to be even remotely difficult, but when enabled the system will shift by itself to maintain a consistent cadence, and even when AutoShift isn't turned on the Coast Shift feature can be used to, you guessed it, shift while coasting, at least as long as a certain minimum speed is maintained. The Transmission derailleur has a wire running from it to the main battery, so that's one less battery to remember to charge. The Reverb AXS dropper post is the other battery powered component on the bike, and for taller riders it could be a source of frustration, since there isn't any option with more than 170mm of drop, at least not yet, and if it's swapped out for something else the cockpit configuration ends up looking a little cluttered. It does work, it's just not pretty. As for the motor itself, the Powertrain puts out 90 Nm of torque, and is powered by a 720 Wh battery, a welcome increase over the 630 Wh battery on the Shimano version of the Repeater.  GeometryTo go along with the 10mm increase in front and rear travel, the Repeater Powertrain has a slacker, 63.5 degree head angle. The chainstays measure a generous 455mm on all sizes, and the seattube angle has been steepened slightly to 78.2-degrees. The reach numbers remain the same as before – it seems like the days of that number increasing with every new model are behind us – and ranges from 425mm on a small to 510mm on a size large. ModelsPricesX0 - $11,999 USDGX - $10,499 USDRide ImpressionsEven though the original Repeater came out less than two years ago, there's a noticeable difference in refinement between the original and the Powertrain model. There's a refreshing lack of motor rattle when coasting downhill, and the actual whir of the motor when pedaling is on the quieter side as well. As I mentioned in my initial write-up of the Powertrain, the motor performance will feel very similar to that of a Specialized Levo, which makes sense considering the hardware comes from the same manufacturer.  It's good to see the option to set up the Repeater with mixed wheels, although I think Transition could have made that the standard spec for all the models and no one would have batted an eye. Remember, we're talking about a full-powered, 170mm machine here that's made for rough, steep trails. The reduced chance for a buzzed butt and improved maneuverability would be a worthy tradeoff over the slightly improved rollover ability, at least in my mind. As it is, though, the Repeater feels very composed in the steeps, with plenty of speed on tap. The extra travel is there for handling the big hits, but I wouldn't say it's diminished its climbing abilities at all. If anything, the Powertrain motor allows for a more natural cadence while climbing, which can be helpful when treading the line between traction and spinning out on extra-steep sections. There's also the Auto Shift feature, but I didn't use it much on my ride on the Repeater. It's not really a feature I'm too concerned about either – it's there for riders who want to enable it, but definitely not something I'd consider a 'must have.'Overall, the new Repeater seems like a solid step up from the original. The extra travel and bigger battery make sense on a full-power machine like this, and it's certainly a worthy option for knocking out big rides on rugged terrain.  

","Probably in the minority here, but Black/Red is about the least desirable color combo."

The organisers adapted it to the level of the competition, the start was a bit lower and for the first time it avoided the famous Rock'n'Roll section. However, the transport to the start was quite classic, by chairlifts as at the first World Cup in 1999 (both have since been replaced). It took a bit longer than the gondola, but at least the riders had a good rest.The competitors were very happy with the new version of the course. It was well designed and prepared, with lots of fresh loam on the new sections. Even in dry conditions, the course was very challenging as the ground was very slippery.On a sunny Saturday, the organisers also organised an e-bike ride as part of the Let's Go Biking! Programme of the Slovenian Cycling Federation.More than a hundred riders, representing four countries, came to Mariborsko Pohorje for the fourth and final race of the season. After Saturday's course practice (and a few crashes and, unfortunately, injuries), 96 riders took to the start on Sunday.Luka Berginc's SeasonIn the men's category, Luka Berginc (DH Visit Pohorje) was the fastest for the fourth time this year, and for the fifth time if we count the trial race at Golovec at the beginning of the season. He also won the seeding run and took all the points there as well. In the whole season, he only missed out on 20 points in the DH Sljeme seeding run, where Ivan Bašić (Coast Riders) was ahead of him, so Berginc won the Cup overall title with a big advantage.Gašper Jurečič (DGK Pohorje - Spank Team) was second in Maribor final, nine seconds behind Berginc, followed by Croatian national champion Ivan Bašić in third place. Jurečič and Bašić also secured second and third place in the final standings. Both overtook Enej Podlipnik (Bikehanic Lumar), second in the standings before the final, who was injured in training on Saturday. Bašić also passed Jan Cimperman (MTB Trbovlje), who missed the last two races due to injury.The best time recorded on the new course is Berginc's from the final: 2 minutes, 19 seconds and 16 hundredths.Clash of the Young Female RidersIn the absence of Monika Hrastnik, who competed at the World Cup Finals in Canada, the women's juniors Hana Kranjec Žagar (Rajd Ljubljana) and Tina Smrdel (MBK Črni Vrh), the former from the cross country and the latter in the enduro, competed for the win in the first row. Hana won her second race, beating Tina by 95 hundredths of a second in the classification and 53 hundredths of a second in the final. Third place in both races went to Eva Zala Stergar (DGK Pohorje - Spank Team).ResultsMen1st. Luka BERGINC (SLO, DH Visit Pohorje) — 2:19.162nd. Gašper JUREČIČ (SLO, DGK Pohorje - Spank Team) — +9.933rd. Ivan BAŠIĆ (CRO, Coast Riders) — +10.164th. Marco SCHERIAU (ITA, ASD Jams Bike Team Buja) — +10.755th.

Neža ŠTERN (SLO, MTB klub Kranj Scott Team) — +46.52Tight Decision for the Overall Title in Junior MenAmong the U19 junior men, Austria's Sebastian Weinhandl (Radsport Scheicher) won ahead of his compatriot Nikolas Kolle (Bikeclub Giant Strattegg) and Slovenian Nino Popović (KD Rajd).Before the final, a trio of Slovenians were in contention for the overall win in this junior category, and the two Austrians who topped this year's results also mixed things up a bit by taking points – along with Austria's Maximilian Heck, third in the seeding. Series leader Maks Oblak (Supersnurf) was fifth in both runs, with second-placed Maj Babačič (Calcit Bike Team) ahead of him in 4th in both runs, while third-placed Popović was seventh in the seeding and, as mentioned above, the fastest of the Slovenes in third place in the final run. Overall order: Babačič wins the title with a 5 point advantage over Oblak, Popović remains third despite his success in the final.International Also in Older and Younger CategoriesIn the men's master category, Boštjan Volf (Wolf Racing by Wheelbase) won convincingly ahead of Italian Daniele Garbelotto (ASD Jams Bike Team Buja) and Matjaž Rupar (Rajd Ljubljana). Boštjan was once again among the fastest riders of the day, setting the second fastest time of the final run behind Berginc.The U17 Junior final was won by Max Žvegla (Bikehanic Lumar) ahead of Matej Osolin (Calcit Bike Team) and Juš Ažman (KK Završnica).In the U15 boys, the win went to Kamplc Racing from Ajdovščina with Jakob Praček, followed by Croatian Toma Vuk Boban (BK Opušteno) in second and Gabriel Nosan (Calcit Bike Team) in third.In the youngest U13 category, all three podium steps went to the Rajd Ljubljana team. Gal Palčič took first place ahead of Gal Novak and Rok Pavlič.In the amateur category, Andreas Vidovič (DGK Pohorje - Spank Team) was the winner ahead of Gal Jevšenak Kodrič (35 Crew) and Grega Mali (Batt Crew).Full Kenda DH Pohorje results and 20chocolate Cup Final RankingsThe awards will be presented at the Mountain Bike and BMX Commission event after the end of the season.        link=""https://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> View this post on Instagram            A post shared by 20chocolate Downhill Cup (@sloveniadownhillcup)        link=""https://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Max Žvegla (@zveglamax)

New York-based Vivo Sports are now offering highly customisable shifters for SRAM mechanical 12-speed drivetrains, which feature interchangeable 3D-printed shift paddles designed to fine-tune the ""form, fit and feel"" to your needs.Can't say they don't have options...There are twenty options for the lower paddle (used to change into an easier gear) and fourteen for the upper. In addition, there are sixteen options for the housing, nine for the cable tension adjuster and nine for the bar clamp (not including direct mount), but these are just cosmetic. In total, I make that 362,880 possible combinations, or 280 for the shift paddles alone. Central to the concept is something Vivo call ""Thumb Reach Rating"" (TRR). This is a number to indicate how close the shifter paddle is to your thumb - the higher the number, the closer the paddle sits towards the rider, and so the less you have to reach for it. So riders with small thumbs may want a higher ""TRR"".For now, it seems there isn't much to help you decide which of the many paddle shapes will suit you best. There are images on the website and you can contact Vivo for advice, but there isn't a hand measurement-based calculator or anything like that. Once you've bought the shifter for $315, you can buy alternate upper paddles for $15, or $22.50 for lower paddles. Just for context, that's about the cost of a complete Shimano Deore 12-speed shifter.On the other hand, Vivo promises precise positive shifting, clear audible shift clicks, high-quality materials including double cartridge bearings, grippy paddle textures and the ability to upshift with a pull or a push.More information: vivocycling.com.

As you can imagine, this year was a bit of a rodeo, so fasten your seat belts, everyone, and enjoy the show.------------------We would also like to take this opportunity to promote our friend Aven's fundraiser. Aven had a crash a few days after the tour and is now suffering from a spinal cord injury. After 10 weeks in the ICU in Vancouver, he needs all the support from our community.

13,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/tour-de-gnar-2023.html,Photo Story: Tour De Gnar 2023 - Pinkbike,Wild.," In the world of Mountain biking there are a few stand out competitions, there's nothing quite like the Tour de Gnar. Homegrown in British Columbia, ITS BACK! for its 3rd year. A jaw dropping, heart-racing event that pushes the boundaries of what's possible on two wheels. The vision of Yoann Barrelli, gather a crew of top tier athletes from around the globe and showcase the best and most high level riding with the backdrop of the Coast Mountains, BC. This year the Tour de Gnar promised to be bigger and gnarlier than ever before, drawing in 30 riders to tackle the most challenging and breathtaking features the Sea to Sky has to offer. Like Cami Nogueira explained:Its Gnarly as F***Here we go!A 6am meet up in Squamish was on the agenda on a brisk July 26th. Trucks, vans, and cars racks filled to the brim with bikes rolled into the car park, riders ready to receive heavy doses of coffee, waivers and that Yoann/ Nate Stoke!After an introduction, an agenda and firing up of the riders! we set out to the first feature of the day... A warmup? maybe for some athletes there that day. In-N-Out Burger!In-N-Out Burger arrival  SQUAMISH The first features of the day revolved around the Alice lake area in Squamish, it may not come as a surprise that there is probably enough GNAR in this singular location to last most riders a lifetime. The famous giant slab was particularly wet and greasy on this early morning ride, still... that grippy granite stayed true to reputation and the riders smashed it! 3 lines down, Big compressions, endless skids but an absolute ideal scene and exactly how everybody wished to have started the day. The crowds had already started to grow, spectators coming to bear witness to absolute wizardry on 2 wheels, the trailsides were packed!Next it was the Highway to Hell/ Hueso drops. Tucked away in the moody fogged up forests it was time for riders to snipe some absolute sends. The features chosen are not just an act of confidence, these landings some barely longer than the bikes themselves require bike control and awareness only achieved with years of compounding skill. Crowds lined the take offs and landings for an insane display, Multiple riders on multiple features doing what they do best. The crew nailed it!""Gouranga"" trail provided the final selections of the Squamish Zone. 3 Features all rolled into a single descent of Craziness. We accurately measured that the Highest feature, ""The surgeon"" from Drop to landing was approximately 2.75 Yoann Barrelli's high to give context.  Lewis Buchananon took to the stage as the first rider to drop and sniped it, Infectious confidence.  A few crashes happened, The Gouranga hip seemingly being the make or break feature so far in Squamish. The riders were pumped at this point, I mean... literally how can you not be. With a few crashes and dirt eaten unintentionally, some decided to take a breather, step back and watch. The team spirit really showed in this section and the calculated approach needed to last the day. Mark Matthews stated it perfectly:Its about pushing each other, but also respecting each others boundaries and abilities WHISTLER Against the backdrop of Whistler's majestic mountains, here we were! The Fabled icon of Canadian MTBing. The first feature some locals specials, A double Drop with a zero bail runout into a boulder field, absolutely no room for error, masterminded by Aven Elsberg & Jake Polito. Credit to the team and crowd at this point as the terrain had become so jagged and steep they had to be on the features with the riders! didn't sign up for this!To think that you have to do a technical feature, and this is what you get gifted at the end... its kind of mindblowing - Dan WolfeAven Dropped in first and showed the guys and girls just how to ride it with style, everybody followed suit and what could have easily been a tangle of rocks and rims was avoided with class.A newly imagined, fresh line next. A Barelli concept if you will... ""The line behind my place"". Incredible, gives absolutely no expectations of just how janky and technical this tire popping line is. A balancing act, insane steepness and a runout through some goalpost trees whilst a full circle of shouting friends and fans encase you in wooded section behind Yoann's house. This is the definition of homegrown madness.If you make it between the trees your fineAfter a few tire changes, rim checks and Ryan Rodriquez heroically saving Nicole Kennedy from riding a feature with no bike. The racks were loaded and off the Tour went, North of town. NORTH OF TOWN/ RUTHERFORD A celebration of Freeride, a way to remember all the pioneers of MTBing. These sections and locations feel different, Extremely Raw and intimidating. One move, one shot. Max Grayston Opened up the feature, cleanly showcasing how to make a monumental drop 25ft+ from a cliff onto wooden logs and chicken wire look like riding on the valley trail. Clack! Boom! Slam! every rider was stomping it, avoiding the tree and landing in the sweet spot until Ray Fournier snaps the landing! without hesitation Yoann appears with a 10ft Long plank he found and the Crew set to work on repairs. With a final heavy blow from a big rock and Patrik Chomists gym sessions not going to waste, the session is back on! With the sun starting to drop in the sky the aim remains on focus with only a couple features left.Deadfall (The riders favourite) Smooth, great runout and absolutely stunning! Photographing the deadfall drop during the golden hours was an absolute dream come true. Patrik Chomist performing the biggest Table, Jack Pelland styling out the most impressive T-bog high in the sky  and Max Grayston/ Alex Holowko Throwing down Suicide no handers. The stoke was high for sure! Nicole Kennedy sent it to the moon and completed the feature for the first time ever, to be greeted and praised by everyone at the landing. it was a special moment and by far the loudest Cheer of the entire day, the perfect playground for progression and the best support around!You guys don't know how long I waited to do that! - Nicole KennedyThe FINAL FEATURE, presented brand new for the day. The Rutherford Spine. A true embellishment of the Freerider state of mind, seeing, planning and turning an idea to a reality to be ridden. A keystone of what the Tour de Gnar stands for Fun, Achievement and Creativity. Hundreds of people (2000+ if you ask Nate or max) turned out to witness what would be the grand finale of the 2023 Tour, seriously though there was a huge crowd and the whole community turned out and celebrated! A stadium of boulders, piled high on top of each other, unridable if not for the work and vision of the team. Riders dropped in one after the other, a skinny exposed section, onto a downsloping boulder and a spicy drop with a slight turn involved. 11.5 hours after the Early start in Squamish, absolute respect to the riders for being able to continue their focus and meet the physical demands, just incredible. Unfortunately Felipe Barberis had a heavy fall, needing Medical attention and as a result of the fatigue the riders were experiencing/ injury of a friend, the event was stopped early to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the participants and to reduce any injury caused from tiredness/ lack of focus.Thankyou to everybody who helped make the event an overwhelming success by either helping, participating or supporting this movement. The crowds that turned out were fantastic and the Athletes, we have the upmost respect for you pushing yourselves to your limits, your inspirations for us all.

The 2023 event is staying at the 2022 site, with many of the returning riders improving and refining their previous year's lines.Historically, the second year of a venue at Rampage sees more built up stuff and bigger tricks, as the athletes have had more time to get comfortable with their lines. There's lots of new stuff this year too, the Gee/Brendog/Szymon line off the top to lily-pad onto the ""Battleship"" is absolutely psychotic, and several of the athletes have mentioned that Brendan's new canyon gap needs a ridiculous amount of commitment. Most of the rookies and riders who weren't at this venue last year are smartly choosing to evolve older lines. There are no extra points awarded for your build, because it'd be unfair to the first timers.I'm sure the ""it's too slopestyle"" brigade will be out in full force, but even the crustiest of commenters will be able to appreciate some of these lines. The top section especially has riders choosing between impossibly steep, and impossibly tech and exposed. So many iconic moves (see what I did there?) have gone down on this course, and the stage is set for a massive week. Today saw a bunch of folks put tires to dirt—notably Gee was flowing the top of his line, and Szymon flipped his canyon gap (and I believe sent a double lower down on course). Bienve flipped that canyon too. Usually riders don't start linking their lines up until later in the week, so this bodes well for a massive show on Friday. We say it every year but it bears repeating: everything is way bigger than it looks in the broadcast, and everyone will be pushing hard to make their mark on the mountain.Szymon Godziek double dropping. At least one rider plans on sending this straight to the second landing.Bender and Spangler, a couple of legends.Jealous.Brett Tippie is on the ground getting the goods for us this year.Video guy Stefan, social media manager Hannah, and a very jetlagged Dan Wolfe are on the ground for us as well.Dust flying from the lower part of Tom Van Steenbergen's line.Thomas Genon and Adolf Silva eyeing pieces of their lines.It's hard to capture the scale of these hits. Gee's drop on the left (with two ant-sized people at the takeoff) is 60+ vertical feet, and gives me a pit in my stomach just looking at it.In a sea of side by sides, this was the coolest rig on the mountain.K'nex for grownups.Some lines in those hills.Pascal Sapunar just took part in the Desert Days gathering.The man tasked with keeping up with Tippie this week.

Behind Riley, there was a close battle for second as Bjorn Riley almost made it a US one-two but resurgent Adrien Boichis had a burst of speed on the final lap to end the day 16 seconds back. It was a perfect weekend for Ronja Blöchlinger as she followed up her XCC win with the XCO victory and took the 2023 overall title. Ronja Blöchlinger faced some early race challenges but she kept on fighting to cross the line 31 seconds ahead of 2nd place. Noëlle Buri ended the day in 2nd place after a final lap overtake of US champ Madigan Munro.Loana Lecomte was in her own league through the mud as she won the final race of the season.

Puck Pieterse managed to stay just ahead of Jolanda Neff to complete the top three riders.Tom Pidcock ended his season as it started with a World Cup win. Following a close battle with Mathias Flückiger, a second puncture for the Swiss rider left the race open for Tom Pidcock to charge into the lead and build a gap that was impossible to close with only a single lap remaining. Marcel Guerrini made it two Swiss riders inside the top three as he crossed the line behind Mathias Flückiger.

We will keep this article updated with videos as they come in, check out all the action so far below. Red BullMatt Jones walks us through the Red Bull Rampage digging process and explores some of the new lines for 2023. Riders are allowed a team of two diggers, 75 sandbags, and ten days in the Utah desert to build a winning line at the world's wildest freeride mountain bike event.Red Bull Rampage returns to the former site of the 2008-2013, 2022 competitions, which last saw riders on the course almost a decade ago. It’s the site of the contest’s most iconic moments, with new history-making sends to occur this week in Utah.— Red BullBrendan FaircloughSeeing the zone for the first time has to be the most overwhelming feeling. the mountain has been rinsed over the years. Its so tough turning up to a zone that everyone has already used the year before. Meaning they have two weeks more digging time than we have to come up with a line.— Brendan FaircloughFirst dig day here at RedBull rampage. Things are looking insane. Tough days but a whole left to get things shaped up.— Brendan FaircloughBuilding the most exposed feature at RedBull Rampage EVER!! Mountain biking in the desert is no mean feet, this place gets scarier every year as the mountain fills up with insane MTB jumps and drops. Can't help looking over on to some riders lines though and it looking like a bike park line, scare bike park but one none the less.Lets bring big mountain back.— Brendan FaircloughKyle StraitBack to Red Bull Rampage. This year, with a new perspective on tackling the line we could not complete last year. Digging starts today.— Kyle StraitWe decided to switch things up a bit this year and turn our diggers against each other for some light-hearted fun with the inaugural King of the Cliffs.

Over the years he's been a mechanic, a builder, a coach and a guide. These days he heads up the design and development work at Airdrop, which is all done in-house. He's also a fixture in and around Wharncliffe where he digs & rides on a daily basis. In this First Look video we take a close look at James' Edit MX prototype. We build the bikes we want to ride, and ride the bikes we build.—Airdrop BikesThe Edit MX is the eagerly anticipated fifth iteration of the Airdrop Edit. As a small (four people) and independent (self funded) brand, we've stuck to our plan which is to ""build the bikes we want to ride, and ride the bikes we build."" So far, that's meant alloy frames and 27.5"" wheels - even for our DH bike, the Slacker. And while that's won us friends amongst the die-hard riders that we tend to attract, it has caused a lot of people to ask if there would ever be an Airdrop bike with at least one 29"" wheel. Which is a fair question.We're never going to build a bike just because it's the latest trend; that's just not how we operate. We have to be all-in to develop a new bike and bring it to production. So the challenge was to figure out if we could take the Edit platform to the next level, using mixed wheels, but keep the fun and creativity that we've built a reputation for. We think we've done that. All-in-all, the Edit MX is a faster and much more capable bike than its predecessor. But it's still very much an Airdrop bike. And although it may look superficially like previous bikes, this is an all-new design. That becomes clear when you get up close with it.Oh, and before we get accused of selling our souls.... we've done a new 27.5"" version as well.In keeping with our 'homegrown' ethos, we produced this video in-house on our local trails. Just like the prototype, it may not be super polished, but it's all us. If you want to skip to the bit you're interested in, no worries. We've set up chapters in the video (the pan-and-zoom-drum-n-bass-bit starts at 2:47).The Edit MX is set for launch in November 2023. For anyone who's super keen, preorders are now live. As with all our bikes, The Edit MX and Edit 27.5 frames will be produced in small batches, and bikes built to order. All the details will be out with the launch but if you have questions, post them in the comments and we'll do our best to answer.airdropbikes.com

Ten percent of the proceeds of Tailwind Limited Edition Apple Cider flavor will be donated to Bigger than the Trail. “Tailwind Nutrition and Bigger than the Trail have established a relationship based on our shared core values that helps drive awareness of the importance of mental health,” says Tod Beck of BTTT. “As we continue to work together, we are finding new channels to educate the community through the Tailwind Nutrition and Bigger Than The Trail following.” “Millions of people live with a mental illness and it not only affects them but also those around them — family, friends, or coworkers,” says Jenny Vierling, Co-founder of Tailwind Nutrition. “With 10% of the proceeds from Apple Cider going to Bigger Than the Trail, we can help support Bigger Than the Trail’s mission to help bring light to the real struggles and challenges that are associated with mental health.”The Apple Cider flavor will be sold online at TailwindNutrition.com and is available in four-pack bundles for $10. The four-packs will be wrapped in paper rather than plastic, further contributing to Tailwind’s sustainability efforts.

Yeti riders Adolf SIlva and Reed Boggs each have a custom-painted SB165, both with a 'mini-mullet' setup, with a 27.5"" front wheel and 26"" rear. Expect to see these bikes and riders getting sideways and upside down very soon. There are a bunch more bike checks and other content on the way, but in the meantime enjoy a quick look at these snazzy freeride machines.Reed Bogg’s SB165 Mini-Mullet “Rampage 2023 - Stoked! Revisiting last year’s venue, I decided to switch my bike setup a bit to add some flare to my line. I’m going with the same frame - Yeti SB165 - but this time I have a 180mm Marzocchi prototype single crown on there, equipped with a MTN Components hydraulic gyro. I’m also running a mini-mullet setup with a 26-inch rear wheel. This makes the bike much lighter and more playful. Might be my favorite bike yet, especially with the custom paint job. I tried to keep it clean with the white and a hint of Yeti turquoise. I’m so excited to get these tires in the dirt!”—Reed BoggsAdolf Silva’s Dipped Dream“I’ve always been a big fan of tie dyes and water slicks. I have done these types of paint jobs on helmets in the past, but have never got it done to a bike. With the opportunity of getting a custom bike for Rampage, I thought it was a perfect opportunity to take advantage. When I was told I was going to get a custom bike, I didn’t even have to think about it, it just popped straight into my mind.

23,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/review-kuat-huk-tailgate-pad.html,Review: Kuat Huk Tailgate Pad - Pinkbike,A simple-to-install solution for transporting bikes in the back of a truck.," When it comes to transporting mountain bikes the tailgate pad is one of the simplest methods, provided you have a truck. Kuat’s Huk improves that experience by speeding up the installation process and polishing the aesthetics while hosting a flap for backup cameras.On tap for sizing are five Huk models. The mid-size heights come in 51 and 54” pads that carry five bikes, plus there’s also a stubby 25”-width Huk that holds just two. For full-size truck owners, a 61” width model has a six-bike capacity with two tailgate profile options, straight or curved. The Huk product page includes a fit guide to select the right pad for your vehicle if you're unsure which best suits your whip.Huk Details • Bike capacity: 2 or 5 for mid-size trucks, 6 for full-size • Sizes: 25, 51, 54, 61, 61"" curved• TPU outer/ fleece inside material• Fold up camera window• 10 downtube strap loop positions• Price: $298 USD• kuat.com The two-bike carrier costs $149 USD, but that price doubles to $298 USD for full tailgate coverage. Each Huk tailgate pad comes with straps to secure the bikes’ downtubes and a three-year warranty.INSTALLATIONInstalling the Kuat Huk is a breeze thanks to hooked straps that secure to the outside of the tailgate. This method may be more costly to produce but is incredibly sensible - no more fumbling fingers to feed the straps up through the tailgate gap or covering your clothes in mud while holding the tailgate pad in place. I started with the straps laced near the end of their length on the inside facing buckle, placing the pad on the open tailgate, and lining up the folds. Next, lifting and closing the tailgate lets gravity do the work, pulling the metal hooks into the gap at the end of the bed. After fishing out the straps and placing the hooks in the eyelets, center the pad and cinch it up.BIKE RETENTIONThe Kuat Huk retains bikes moderately well, but although no shuttle scaring occurred there could be a few improvements. The strap system is fairly basic. On this 54"" Huk pad, there are 10 loops to feed the downtube security strap through. Placing the strap through two loops spaces the bikes evenly but shortens the strap length, something to consider for e-bikes or unconventional frame shapes. That means you'll need to offset the strap to one side to make the most of the length, which could clash with the rest of the fleet's spacing. When not in use, it's critical that the straps are closed or they'll go by the wind. No extras are provided. The loops that the straps feed through could also be placed closer to the top edge of the tailgate to maximize the reach, but the plastic buckles never lost tension.DURABILITYOne of the primary concerns when using a tailgate pad is potential damage to your truck's paint. The Huk ensures there's no rubbing on the inside of the pad thanks to the soft fleece material. On the outside, there are fewer edges on the Huk which is where tailgate pads typically wear first. The TPU material has stood up to a summer of intense UV rays, showing no signs of wear or holes.While the foam underneath the inside edge of the tailgate does a decent job at padding the frame, thicker foam would provide extra protection against rough road impacts.When wrestling camp gear and multiple bikes into the bed, I'd often lower the tailgate, place the bikes on and then close it up. This led to lifting the velcro flap frequently which prematurely wore out the clingy material. I never rolled up the camera cover but that made me question how long the velcro would last in this area if you frequently used this feature.Lined up against the Race Face T2 tailgate pad, the Kuat Huk offers a sleeker appearance and discrete logo. If you're into colorful styles though, you're stuck with plain black as the only option for the Huk.COMPARISONThe standout feature of the Kuat Huk is the reverse straps and alloy hooks, making installation significantly faster and cleaner. It does falls slightly short when it comes to downtube strap placement and access compared to the Race Face. The straps can be a bit challenging when multiple bikes are loaded, especially compared to the convenient velcro loops on the Race Face tailgate pad. At the moment, the $298 USD Huk is three times the price of the Race Face T2 (marked at $99, down from $209). If you set it and forget the tailgate pad for the season, then it's tough to justify the extra cost of the Huk.The camera flap folds out of the way more elegantly than the velcro punch-out style of the Race Face T2.Pros+ Fast install that doesn’t leave you covered in dirt+ Snug fit and low profileCons- Downtube straps and placement could use refinement- Plenty of cheaper options exist with a similar function Pinkbike's Take The main takeaway from the Kuat Huk tailgate pad is the simplified installation process with its additional hooks on the outside, however, that does come at a high price. While it has a few minor quirks, the functionality and aesthetics deliver a reliable solution for hauling bikes on your truck.—Matt BeerVisit the high-res gallery for more images from this review. 

","I still contend that an old blanket is actually superior, and not just because it's free.

It takes moments to throw over the tailgate, with no straps to fight.

When it gets dirty, you just put it through the laundry. No paint scratches ever.

If retention is a concern, add a ratchet strap. All truck owners should already have a couple of those.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk"

Thank you to every single rider, racer, parent, spectator, volunteer, and everyone else who came out and made this season the best season of Canadian enduro ever. You have all helped to make enduro great again and helped build what we would consider one of the best national enduro series in the world. Cheers to a great summer of racing and many more to come. RD #9 Eastern Cup Recap  Bromont, montagne d'expériences needs no introduction to mountain biking, they’ve been hosting World Championships since 2008, and when you meet their team of trail builders, operations, lifties, and event staff, you see a level of professionalism that is unmatched. Teamwork truly does make the dream work.Previously, we worked with a local organizer Maxx Events (shout-out to Nicolas!), to license a few events, so since our core team had never been there to activate an event, we were quite surprised at what lurked east of Montreal! Upon putting tires to dirt (or rock…), we had our minds blown! Each and every stage the team of Cedric, Oliver, Adam, Marc-Etienne and the BME chose was better than the next!There were slabs, rock gardens, roots, wide open sections with more line choice than one could dream of, gnar, flow, jumps, we could go on forever. The trails really encompassed a little bit of everything. A perfect way to put the racers to the test and crown our Eastern Cup champions. Now don’t be mistaken - this race is not for everyone, the tracks were insanely challenging, and for some, it was a hard day in the saddle. The goal of the Eastern Cup is to make the most competitive and challenging enduro race in Eastern Canada, and from the feedback, we did. Many people were grateful for how humbling the course was, yet the stoke was all-time, and we are so excited to be investing into an event that will grow to be the one event in the east that captures the essence of Canadian Enduro racing.The course featured 6 stages, covering nearly 30 km, and just over 1700m of climbing. Thankfully though, riders were treated to several lift-accessed stages. On the day, it was none other than Jennifer McHugh (B.C., former QC resident), who took the top spot in Pro Women, with Nathan Sterckx (QC) in first for Pro Men. In the U21 category, Jacob Quist (BC) rode insanely well against local Marc-Olivier Domaine, yet the pits were abuzz with chatter of how Jacob’s younger brother Mateo racing in U17 would’ve clinched not only 1st in U21, but also 3rd in Pro Men. The story of the young guns repeats itself with U21 Women’s local Charlie Bernard putting down a heater of a time that would’ve landed her in the number three position in Pro Women - the future is fast in QC!Want to skip straight to the results?

Patrick, hat’s off to you. Oh, and we forgot to mention that his team frequents the podium.Trail Love For this event, we were fortunate enough to be riding in a bike park where the trail crew welcomed us with freshly leaf-blown trails, new trails, new features (aka the step-down), and a whole bunch of fresh turns.

Split Mountain is a 14,000 foot peak with a perfect couloir dividing two prominent summits. Visually, it’s a line that begs to be skied yet is guarded by a series of icefalls, rock steps, and blue ice patches that make it extremely challenging. On top of that, the towering walls of the couloir present significant rockfall hazard along with an upper basin that can create dangerous avalanche conditions. It’s a line that requires patience, perfect timing… and many many attempts. Over the last four years, Cody Townsend, Nick Russell, and cinematographer Bjarne Salén have been waiting, trying, scoping, and learning about the history of this line, its moods, its conditions, and its energy, to successfully, and safely, ski it.

Puck Pieterse is back in third with Jolanda Neff hunting the 2023 overall series champ down.11:05 PDT: Loana Lecomte is Unmatched on the DescentsLoana Lecomte is impressive on the downhills today as both Jenny Rissveds and Puck Pieterse can't come close to her speed through the rocks and roots.11:11 PDT: Loana Lecomte Starts the Final Lap 32 Seconds Ahead of 2ndLoana Lecomte has taken control of today's race as she goes into the final lap as more rain hits the track.11:23 PDT: Jolanda Neff has Nearly Caught Puck PieterseJolanda Neff is just three seconds back from Puck Pieterse as there is a battle going on for the third-place spot.11:28 PDT: Loana Lecomte Wins After an Incredible PerformanceAfter a puncture on the first lap Loana Lecomte fought back to take the win at MSA.The Elite Men's Race as it HappenedRace Updates:12:31 PDT: Charlie Aldridge Leads the Elite Men into the Start LoopCharlie Aldridge is the first rider up the climb on the start loop as he starts off the race with a very high pace.12:33 PDT: Simon Andreassen Goes to the Front for the First DownhillIt's another Cannondale rider who moves to the front as Simon leads teammate Charlie Aldridge.12:35 PDT: Charlie Aldridge is First Out on Lap 1Charlie Aldridge is looking good after the start loop as he leads Christopher Blevins into lap one.12:37 PDT: Simon Andreassen Takes Back the LeadSimon Andreassen moves back to the front with Victor Koretzky in 2nd. Nino Schurter is all the way back in 30th.12:45 PDT: Mathias Flückiger Moves to the FrontMathias Flückiger loves these conditions and he is setting a high speed at the front as he quickly builds a gap of four seconds to Simon Andreassen.12:47 PDT: Nino Schurter & Jordan Sarrou are Way BackThe riders battling for the overall title have had a disaster of a start today as Nino Schurter is in 27th and Jordan Sarrou sits in 41st.12:49 PDT: Mathias Flückiger Leads Tom Pidcock by 10 Seconds into Lap 2Mathias Flückiger is powering away at the front of the race but the chasing group is full of talent with Tom Pidcock and Victor Koretzky in the mix.12:52 PDT: Tom Pidcock Shuts the Gap to Mathias FlückigerTom Pidcock is now just off the rear wheel of Mathias Flückiger as he is closely followed by Simon Andreassen in third.12:56 PDT: Mathias Flückiger Pulls Ahead by 12 Seconds as Tom Pidcock Struggles in the WetMathias Flückiger has created a lead of 12 seconds through the incredibly tough rocky descent.12:58 PDT: Flat Rear Tire for Mathias FlückigerMathias Flückiger has to pull into the pits and loses the lead he built in the last downhill. Tom Pidcock leads the race with Charlie Aldridge in 2nd.13:02 PDT: Tom Pidcock Leads by 16 Seconds into Lap 2 There are two World Champs at the front as Elite champ Tom Pidcock leads with U23 champ Charlie Aldridge in 2nd. Mathis Flückiger has ridden back from his puncture to sit on the rear wheel of Charlie.13:05 PDT: Mathias Flückiger Takes 2nd PlaceMathias Flückiger looks to be closing back in on Tom Pidcock and if he can get in front before the rocky downhill he should be able to build a lead again.13:12 PDT: Nino Schurter has Ridden Back to 13thNino Schurter is coming through the ranks and currently, we believe he will still secure the overall win if he stays in this spot.13:17 PDT: Mathias Flückiger Leads Tom Pidcock with Three Laps to GoThere's nothing between the top two riders as both are keeping the speed high through the mud.13:27 PDT: Nino Schurter Takes 10thNino Schurter continues to rise up the results as he now places in 10th. Nino's next targets will be Joshua Dubau and Luca Schwarzbauer who are around five seconds in front of him.13:28 PDT: Tom Pidcock Drops 7 Seconds BackWe are not sure what happened but Mathias Flückiger was able to make a seven-second lead on Tom Pidcock. The World Champ looks to be going hard on the pedals to catch up so it could have been a small mistake that cost him the time.13:29 PDT: Mathias Flückiger Leads by 8 Seconds into the Penultimate LapMathias Flückiger has managed to hold his small lead against Tom Pidcock through the start/finish area.13:32 PDT: Nino Schurter Rises to 8thNino Schurter overtakes Joshua Dubau and Luca Schwarzbauer and he is now looking far more secure in the overall standings.13:38 PDT: Another Rear Flat for Mathias FlückigerDisaster for Mathias Flückiger as he gets a second flat tire and will hand over the lead to Tom Pidcock. With around one and a half laps left, it is very unlikely he could close the gap to Pidcock after the wheel change.13:40 PDT: Mathias Flückiger is 24 Seconds Back After a Wheel ChangeMathias Flückiger's team were rapid with the wheel change so he really didn't lose that much time. 27 seconds is a large gap but Mathias has nothing to lose in the descents.13:44 PDT: Tom Pidcock Starts the Lap with a 33-Second LeadTom Pidcock has a strong lead into the final lap but anything can happen on this course so the race might not be over just yet.13:51 PDT: Nino Schurter Drops his ChainNino Schurter has dropped back three places to 11th as his chain drops off and he struggles to get it back on.13:51 PDT: Tom Pidcock Wins in MSATom Pidcock ends his season with a win as he goes 26 seconds ahead of Mathias Flückiger.Full Results:Elite WomenElite Men

Race winner Vali Höll lost 0.68 seconds to the French racer. Nina Hoffmann was one and a half seconds back here as she set the sixth-fastest time.Finn Iles was the fastest out the gate for the elite men as he led Ronan Dunne by 0.25 seconds. Loic Bruni was the only podium ride to place within the top five here as he lost 0.27 seconds to his Specialized teammate.Sector 2The next sector saw the race winners start to build their leads with Vali Höll and Jackson Goldstone going fastest. Vali Höll managed to build a lead of 0.79 seconds to Nina Hoffmann with Marine Cabirou setting the third-fastest time, almost two seconds off the pace.Jackson Goldstone also built a solid advantage through the second sector finding around 1.79 seconds on Finn Iles. Ethan Craik was really gaining momentum through here on his way to an incredible 2nd-place finish, he broke the timing beam in sector two with the third-best time.Sector 3Marine Cabirou was back as the fastest rider through the third split as she was on a great run before her crash. Marine built an advantage of 0.49 seconds on Nina Hoffmann through this sector and pulled back 0.81 seconds from Vali Höll.Jackson Goldstone continued to extend his lead in the third split as he went 1.31 seconds up on Ethan Craik. Ethan Craik's second-best time in this split placed him 0.02 seconds ahead of Leogang winner Andreas Kolb.Sector 4The fourth split saw the race winners back on top as the infamous MSA rocks proved to be a make-or-break moment for many riders in finals. Vali Höll had no issues through this section finding a massive gap of over two seconds on Monika Hrastnik. Vali really built her 13-second lead to Nina Hoffmann here as she went over nine seconds quicker through this split alone.Jackson Goldstone didn't find quite that much time in the elite men's racing but he was able to gap Ethan Craik by 0.33 seconds. Ethan was the only rider within 0.84 seconds of the race victor as Dakotah Norton secured third place through here.Sector 5In the final sprint to the line Vali Höll was again the rider to beat as she went 0.57 seconds up on Veronika Widmann and almost a second quicker than Monika Hrastnik. Nina Hoffmann lost a lot of time to the race winner here as she set the seventh-fastest time and dropped back from Vali by 2.82 seconds.Loris Vergier was the master of the final sector finding 0.36 seconds on Jackson Goldstone. Luca Shaw put in a great performance here taking third place and only losing 0.01 seconds to race leader Jackson.Story of the RaceElite WomenElite MenThe Perfect RunElite WomenThe Perfect Run: 4:38.640 (1.493 seconds faster than the race winner)// Marine Cabirou: 59.777 // Vali Höll: 1:46.598 // Marine Cabirou: 44.603 // Vali Höll: 40.115 // Vali Höll: 27.547 //Elite MenThe Perfect Run: 3:56.094 (1.742 seconds faster than the race winner)// Finn Iles: 52.277 // Jackson Goldstone: 1:28.996 // Jackson Goldstone: 38.252 // Jackson Goldstone: 32.327 // Loris Vergier: 24.242 //Battle for the PodiumElite WomenElite MenLap Time ImprovementYou can hover over the graph to reveal the lap improvement times.You can hover over the graph to reveal the lap improvement times.Elite Women's Winner Split TrackingElite Men's Winner Split TrackingStats BreakdownThe 10 Elite Women's race runs were plotted.The top 15 race runs were plotted before including results at positions 20, 25 and 29.Overall StandingsTalking PointsJackson Goldstone was Unrivalled Through Split 2There's no denying that Jackson Goldstone's performance at Mont-Sainte-Anne was unmatched as he backed up a wild semi-final run with an equally incredible finals ride. The most impressive part of Jackson's run was through the second split where he schooled the elite men and gapped a charging Finn Iles by around 1.79 seconds. Not only was this split quicker than everyone else by a large margin he also beat his dry split time from qualifying by 1.711 seconds. In fact, looking at Jackson's splits the only sector he didn't improve upon in finals (from either qualifying or semis) was the first split where he was 1.034 seconds back from his qualifying run.Vali Höll was Only Beaten in One Split by a Top 5 RiderVali Höll wrapped up her amazing 2023 season with another perfect race weekend as she won qualifying, semi-finals and finals. Not only did Vali have another weekend with a triple win but in finals she also managed to be the fastest of the podium finishers in all but one split. The only rider on the podium to beat Vali through a split was Nina Hoffmann who went 0.328 seconds up in the third sector. Outside of the podium the only riders to go quicker than Vali in a split were Marine Cabirou and Tahnee Seagrave although both riders ended up pushing too hard and faced difficulties in the lower part of the course.What a Result for Ethan CraikFinally, Ethan Craik deserves plenty of recognition for his career-best elite World Cup result seeing him take 2nd place behind Jackson. Not only did Ethan manage to take the silver medal position but he also set some rapid split times with two second places and no other sectors lower than 9th. Ethan will be a rider to watch when we return to World Cups next year. 

","Would have loved to see Jackson/Finn in a 1-2 finish.  By my math, Finn in 2nd would have given him third in the overall by 3 points over Loris.  Despite all the (deserved) grumbling about the switch from Redbull this was am all time season when it comes to the actual racing.  Great way to end an great season."

Loic Bruni: 24.874Sector BreakdownSector 1The top split saw the qualifying winners come out on top as both Vali Höll and Loic Bruni led over the first 50 seconds of the course at Mont-Saint-Anne. In the women's racing, Vali Höll managed to find 0.6 seconds against Nina Hoffmann with Veronika Widmann falling over 1.3 seconds off the pace in third. While Marine Cabirou would take 2nd by the finish line she was 4th here and 1.7 behind Vali. Loic Bruni also secured a sizeable lead here as he bested Finn Iles by just over 0.5 seconds. No other rider would be within 1.2 seconds as Andreas Kolb set the third-fastest time through here. Sector 2Vali Höll was once again on top leading through the second sector as she won a very close fight with Nina Hoffmann and Marine Cabirou. Amazingly Nina and Marine, who are battling in the overall standings, set the exact same time through here. Both riders were just 0.29 seconds behind Vali's split winning time.The second split saw a new face at the front with Troy Brosnan taking his first of two split wins. 0.02 seconds behind was Loic Bruni who is really showing his strength in qualifying as he is putting everything into securing the overall. Andreas Kolb took third again and was over a second back from the leading two riders. Sector 3Split three saw Nina Hoffmann take her one and only fastest sector as she pulled ahead of Marine Cabirou by around 0.8 seconds. Vali Höll was right in the mix breaking the timing beam in third. Loic was back at the front of the men's racing as he went 0.09 up on Andreas Kolb. Troy Brosnan went third fastest, 0.16 back from Loic.Sector 4Marine Cabirou kick-started some serious momentum in the fourth split as she led Vali Höll by 0.5 seconds, this would pull Vali's overall race lead down to 1.09 seconds. Nina Hoffmann lost a good chunk of time here falling over two seconds back in 6th. In the men's qualifying session, Ethan Craik has found something special here as he went 0.64 seconds faster than Troy Brosnan and bumped himself from 5.1 to 3.5 seconds off qualifying leader Loic Bruni. Troy Brosnan went second fastest with Jackson Goldstone 0.05 seconds behind him.Sector 5In the final short sprint to the line, Marine Cabirou had the power to beat Vali Höll pulling back 0.09 seconds on the fastest qualifier. Nina Hoffmann will be left with a lot to ponder before Saturday's big day of racing as she lost almost 0.8 seconds to her overall standings rival. Troy Brosnan returned to the top for the men as he edged ahead of Loris Vergier by 0.02 seconds. Ethan Craik was fast through here setting a time good enough for third. Story of the SessionElite WomenElite MenBattle for the PodiumElite WomenElite MenStats BreakdownThe top 15 qualifying margins were plotted before including results at positions 20 and 24.The top 15 qualifying margins were plotted before including results at positions 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 87.Talking PointsOnly Marine Cabirou & Nina Hoffmann Could Challenge Vali HöllIn the dry and dusty conditions, we saw the same faces at the top of the timesheet as it was the top three overall women setting the fastest times in MSA. Vali Höll is back to her dominant form as she looks to back up a win here last year and end an already amazing season on a high note. While Vali has the overall all-wrapped up the battle for 2nd does rage on and based on qualifying it couldn't be much closer between Marine Cabirou and Nina Hoffmann as the pair both took sector victories although currently, Marine does carry a slight edge into semis and finals. As proven in today's wild Junior racing anything can happen at MSA and with no points on the line for qualifying and semi we could be seeing some of the riders holding back slightly for a big run in finals. Loic Bruni Will Win the Overall if he Repeats his Qualifying ResultThe battle for the elite men's overall is a little bit complicated this year as we have four riders who could mathematically take the title. Loic Bruni holds the best chance currently as he heads into finals with a 60-point lead and with the fastest run in qualifying he has shown he means business this weekend. If Loic can match his speed and result in qualifying or at least placing ahead of Loris Vergier, Jackson Goldstone and Finn Iles then he will win the overall without the need for any calculators to be brought out. Troy Brosnan was Incredibly Consistent Through All 5 SplitsTroy Brosnan is back setting some incredibly consistent splits this weekend as he did not drop outside the top five through any sector this weekend. Troy has yet to win an elite World Cup at MSA although since 2016 he has placed within the top six at every visit to MSA and has been in the top three since 2018. The final stop of the 2023 series may just be his turn to take the top step of the podium here and become the eighth winner in eight rounds this season.

61,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/poll-how-do-you-configure-sram-axs-shifters.html,Poll: What's the Right Way to Configure an AXS Shifter? - Pinkbike,Weigh in even if you don't have fancy electronic shifting.," Amidst our Fall Enduro Bike Field Test four editors were split down the middle when it came to SRAM AXS shifting preferences. As if we didn't have enough shock settings and preferred handlebars to fiddle with, we also had to contend with different rider preferences as to which shifter button did what. And don't get Dario or Henry going on saddle tilt or which brake lever controls the front brake...Mike and Dario both set up the right-hand AXS shifter's lower button to move the derailleur down the cassette to a harder gear, also known as up-shifting. Makes senses, right? Not so fast. I agreed with Henry's preference: the upper button up-shifts to an harder gear. It's only by coincidence that the names align. Ergonomically, this configuration feels more habitual when coming from a mechanical shifter. To downshift, your thumb needs to move lower to grab the longer lever. The inverse configuration reminds me of Shimano's old Rapid Rise. Only when I reminded myself where on the cassette the chain is moving in relation to the button I'm pressing did I make the right moves.  This made for great confusion when jumping between bikes and not bothering to change the setup. At least I didn't get stuck with both buttons moving the derailleur to an easier gear, like poor Henry did.  Which orientation do you prefer, or would you prefer if you haven't tried the AXS shifters? Maybe you're one of the odd few that controls your gearings from either side of the handlebar with two AXS pods, like Rhys Verner. You can read all about his unique Forbidden Druid enduro race setup here. 



How do you configure SRAM AXS shifters?


Does the upper button move the derailleur up or down the cassette?






The upper right-hand button is for shifting to a harder gear (the derailleur moves to the smaller cogs on the cassette).







The upper right-hand button is for shifting to an easier gear (the derailleur moves to the larger cogs on the cassette).







I use a right and left shifter pod to control the shifting (this unconventional method could still have two choices).







Huh? Hippopotamus is my favorite color.

65,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/review-some-pleasant-apparel-surprises-from-yt-enve.html,Review: Some Pleasant Apparel Surprises From YT & Enve - Pinkbike,"YT's new pants are impressive, and Enve's apparel lineup also has several standout items.","            We get a lot of apparel to test, but it's somewhat rare that a piece of clothing really changes your ride experience. I often err a bit too far on the run what ya brung spectrum, but recently a few items have made me realize how good some riding apparel can actually be. These are a few of those pleasant surprises, with more in store.For sizing reference, I'm 6'3"", around 180 lbs., and look like one of the haunting War Boys from Mad Max. YT Gravity PantYT is probably far from the first name to come to mind when you're thinking about riding apparel companies, but let it be known that you should bump them up a few places on that mental list. These are my new favorite riding pants, especially for rides that include more descending than pedaling.The Cordura fabric has been smartly specced to feature thicker durable patches where needed, and thin perforated breathable swaths where you're more likely to heat up. The three pockets are well placed, easy to open and close, and just big enough for the essentials without being silly.Gravity Pants• Cordura ripstop fabric• 3 zip pockets• Black colorway • Sizes: 28""-38"", 32"" tested• Quick-adjust ratchet closure• Hook and loop waist adjuster• MSRP: $99 USD• yt-industries.comThe 2/3 leg zip seems odd, but is actually very useful for getting pads on, dumping heat on climbs, and doing some cool MC Hammer dances in the lift line. Most of the pants I've tried recently have moved towards a ridiculously tight racer-y fit, which in addition to looking goofy just isn't that comfortable for pedaling and moving around on the bike. In order to get something to fit my 32"" waist, everything below that belt line ends up being tighter than I want, especially in the quad/thigh area. These YT pants fit consistently the whole way down, with enough room to move and provide airflow. Big fan.It's also worth noting that they make an excellent Trail version of the pant, that uses a lighter weight fabric and simpler construction. Retail on those is $10 less, and they're the option I'd reach for if I were going out for a long pedal, or wanted some extra coverage for just trail riding or zipping around in the woods. The fit is similarly excellent, and the fabric breathes impressively well. Here's a blurry photo for reference.Enve Composite Long Sleeve JerseyAnother company fairly new to the clothing world, Enve has released a surprisingly deep catalog of apparel and accessories to flesh out their otherwise resin-impregnated fiber lineup. Luckily, this jersey is a bit less stiff than a set of M7 bars, and has proven to be very comfortable for a wide weather window. It's not wool, but has a similar ease of use in terms of temperature - I've been happy in this when it's chilly just the same as when pedaling in the heat. Stink is somewhat helped by the Ionic+ side panels, which help extend the stank range a bit further than typical plastic jerseys.Composite Long Sleeve• 83% poly / 10% lyocell / 4% Ionic+ / 3% spandex• 3 colors • Sizes: S-XXL, L tested• Ionic+ anti-bacterial panels• Reinforced elbow and drop tail• MSRP: $90 USD• enve.comThe reinforced areas are nice for avoiding brush snags, and should hold up better than the stretchy fabric in a crash. I'm a fan of the cut, as it's loose enough to look like a good ol' shirt without feeling baggy. The fabric does a great job of keeping you dry and cool, which has a double benefit when it's drizzly out - remember: cotton kills. Enve Trail PantIt feels like pants are really taking over our previously shorts-heavy sport, and I think it's items like this that are to blame. Pants that are too damn comfortable are just hard to say no to, even when the temperature climbs as much as you do. While I still rock shorts on most hot days, these Trail Pants from Enve are a solid ankle-long option, with a light and stretchy fabric and well-placed ventilation. The side pockets are excellent and very easy to use while riding, and the metal snap closure is operable with gloves on.Trail Pants• 83% nylon / 17% spandex• 2 zip pockets• Black colorway • Sizes: S-XXL, M tested• Metal snap closure• Drawstring waist adjuster• MSRP: $175 USD• enve.comThe drawstring tie waist adjuster seems unnecessary to me, so I just don't use it. If you're more in-between sizes, then it'll certainly help bring a larger size down to fit more snugly. While the leg does taper down quite a bit, and they do have a cuff, the Enve pants fit very nicely and don't feel excessively tight. I prefer cuffless pants, just for ease of use and looks, but these have enough stretch to get on and off easily, and don't ride up your leg as you move around on the bike. For the price, I'd probably choose the YT Trail pants, but these are a very good option.If you want to show off your bulging calves, cool Ironman tattoo, or ankle socks, then you can get all three of these pants in a shorts fit. I've tried all three of those too and my feelings are about the same - just breezier.            

",Those 2/3 length leg zippers also make it easier to stop and pee on the trail.
66,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/who-can-still-win-the-2023-dh-world-cup-overall-title-at-mont-sainte-anne.html,Who Can Still Win the 2023 DH World Cup Overall Title at Mont-Sainte-Anne? - Pinkbike,We have broken down the numbers of who can still take the overall titles this weekend.," After kicking the season off later than usual in June at Lenzerheide we are finally at the eighth and final stop of the 2023 series. Mont-Sainte-Anne closes the door on an incredible season with two titles still hanging in the balance. We have broken down the numbers and tried to make a bit more sense of the stats before racing kicks off for the final round of the 2023 season. How does the points system work?With a maximum of 250 points still to be allocated, things could change quickly at Mont-Sainte-Anne this weekend. With this weekend hosting the season finale, there are no points for qualifying or semi-finals. Interestingly while in past seasons the qualifying points were added to the finals points this season riders will only be awarded the standard amount for their finals position.Rule 4.11.013 states: In the qualifying, semi-final and final rounds, riders are awarded UCI World Cup standing points as per the scale in article 4.11.020. However, in the last round of the UCI World Cup season, no standing points for the qualifying or semi-final rounds will be given. The standing and UCI points will be awarded to the riders according to their position in the final only, as per points scale in article 4.11.020.Elite point scaleJunior point scaleWhat are the current elite overall standings?Top 15 Elite WomenTop 15 Elite MenWho can still win the titles?Mathematically, there are just seven racers left in the running for the 2023 overall titles as Vali Höll and Ryan Pinkerton have already wrapped up the Women's and Junior Men's title fights. In the Elite Men's series, there is a four-way fight for the overall with Loic Bruni holding a slim lead of 60 points over fellow French racer Loris Vergier. Behind Loris are two Canadians looking for a big result on home soil as Jackson is 152 off the lead and Finn Iles is 198 points off his Specialized teammate.The last title up for grabs this weekend is for the Junior Women where Valentina Roa Sanchez holds a 15-point lead against Lisa Bouladou. With 60 points up for grabs in finals the only other rider in with a chance this weekend is World Champ Erice Van Leuven who is 50 points back in third.Elite MenLoic Bruni - 1518Loris Vergier - 1458 ( -60 )Jackson Goldstone - 1366 ( -152 )Finn Iles - 1320 ( -198 )Elite WomenVali Höll is the 2023 Elite Women's UCI DH World Cup Champion.Junior MenRyan Pinkerton is the 2023 Junior Men's UCI DH World Cup Champion.Junior WomenValentina Roa Sanchez - 330Lisa Bouladou - 315 ( -15 )Erice Van Leuven - 280 ( -50 )*While the title has been given to Vali Höll there is still a very close battle between Nina Hoffmann and Marine Cabirou.**Andreas Kolb falls just short of the needed points to battle for the overall, but with Benoit Coualnges out with an injury, there is no one within 250 points of the Atherton rider so he will finish no lower than fifth.*How can the overall titles be decided?Elite MenAfter an unpredictable season of racing, we are down to just four riders able to secure the overall at the final stop this year. With 250 points on offer this weekend and 198 splitting the top four the title will come down to some very close margins with all four riders needing a top result to take the overall.Loris Vergier who currently holds second place will need to better Loic Bruni by 60 points if he wants to move into the lead. If Loris can continue the trend of new winners at each round he will need Loic to rank third or lower in finals. If Loris doesn't win this weekend he will want to avoid a points tie with Loic as he will lose this decision. The lowest Loris can place is 9th because as long as Loic crosses the line in 30th he will pick up a further 30 points. The two Frenchmen have the closest battle raging this week as Loic needs to finish at least in 2nd to fully close Loris out. To make sure he stays ahead of the Canadians Loris will need to lead Jackson by 92 points meaning a finish of 4th or better keeps him ahead. In the fight against Finn, Loris just needs to be 6th to build a gap that can't be closed.Jackson Goldstone is the next rider in the running for the overall title after an impressive first year of elite racing. If Jackson can take a 2nd win in 2023 he will need Loic Bruni to finish 9th or lower. Jackson needs to score 152 points more than Loic but as the 2023 points table still scores 30 points for 30th place we believe this means that the lowest Jackson can place is 2nd if Loic does, in fact, come 30th. If Loic is 8th or better then Jackson can't win.Lastly, there is Finn Iles who with a 198-point deficit to Loic will need a big result and a bad weekend for those currently ahead of him. Once again if Loic finishes last then he will lead Finn by 228 points meaning Finn needs to win this weekend to have any chance of passing Loic in the overall. Loic just needs to be 18th or better to take Finn out of the running this weekend. It's worth adding here that while 30th place does offer 30 points, due to protected rider rules we can sometimes have more than 30 riders in finals. If this happens then any rider ranked outside the top 30 receives no points, further shaking up the overall title fight.Junior WomenThe last title on the line will be the close battle between Valentina Roa Sanchez, Lisa Bouladou and Erice Van Leuven in the Junior Women's race. For the Junior category, there are only 60 points on off at each round leaving the possibility open for any of the current top three riders to secure the title. Lisa Bouladou and Valentina Roa Sanchez are looking strong this weekend as they were eight seconds ahead of everyone in the Junior qualifying session. These two riders are split by only 15 points meaning if Lisa Bouladou can win she will need Valentina Roa Sanchez to finish third or lower. While a third place would mean a tie Valentina has more higher-placed results and we believe this would clinch the title for her. Erice Van Leuven has the most amount of work to do this weekend, if she can win Valentina will need to be 8th or lower and Lisa 5th or worse.

68,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/spotted-under-the-cover-of-specializeds-prototype-downhill-bike.html,Spotted: Under the Cover of Specialized's Prototype Downhill Bike - Pinkbike,It turns out that cover wasn't hiding a motor.," Rumors and theories have circulated amongst the tech keeners about what lay underneath the covers on Specialized's prototype downhill bike for over a year now, but these new photos of Finn Illes' bike in the workstand give a better understanding of the suspension system.From the visible portions of the frame, only so many possibilities existed given the short link at the top of the seatstay (which looks to be from Specialized's Enduro model) and dropout pivot. The use of a Horst Link was clear, but the cover hid the main pivot location, pull-rod and rocker link that's now visible. The CNC'd alloy chainstay truss rotates on a massive main pivot near the top of the chainring, pulling on the rod under the bottom bracket, rotating the rocker link around the black bolt in the CNC'd shock basement, rearward of the three smaller silver bolts. This suspension layout isn't a new concept - Ancillotti Cycles have been using a non-Horst link version for years. On a downhill bike, the ability to keep the bike's weight as low and centered as possible is likely one of the main benefits. It's likely that the axle path is typical of a Horst Link, which is nearly vertical, but moves slightly rearward, then forward significantly.Further tuning could be easily accomplished by swapping the rocker link or even tweaking the geometry by altering the pull-rod length. On the rocker near the lower shock mount, the number ""225"" is visible, implying that different shock lengths and travel amounts are being tested.Loic Bruni has been riding a very similar bike to the one seen here, although there could be more at play there in terms of damping controls since we've seen electronic buttons mounted to his handlebar. When asked, Specialized remained tight lipped about the frame details and its future, but did say where the frame was made and provided a name for the suspension type; ""Under Bottom Bracket"" or ""UBB"". Here's their official statement on what they have dubbed as ""Project Black"".What you’re seeing at the core of this prototype is the UBB suspension system. This novel linkage system enables us to independently fine-tune key ride dynamics components, including axle path, shock leverage rate, and anti-squat/anti-rise characteristics for braking. This decoupling not only enables us to tune the race bikes for elite riders but also provides us with valuable qualitative and quantitative data.What most won’t know is that these prototype UBB bikes are 100% handcrafted with precision at our innovation center in Morgan Hill, California. Each carbon tube is hand-rolled by our in-house composite experts. Lugs, linkage, swingarm, and all billet parts are precision CNC machined within the same facility, with the bonding process executed meticulously.The UBB system has proven to be an extremely effective product development tool for our Ride Dynamics team in influencing the development of recently launched bikes, as well as those that will shape the future of cycling across multiple disciplines. We understand there will be more questions around the UBB suspension system, but we will not be providing further information at this time and will refer you to our Project Black Statement. Project Black: Specialized relies on feedback from professional athletes in both developing and testing advanced pre-production products in real-worldapplications. With this top-level feedback, some of these design elements and products eventually show up in future retail product offerings. We call this Project Black.—Specialized

72,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/first-ride-orbea-occam-sl-and-lt-2024.html,First Ride: Orbea Occam SL & LT - Pinkbike,"There are now two Occams, one with 140mm of travel and a remote lockout, and the other with 150mm of travel."," Orbea have added two new version of the Occam into their lineup – the 140mm Occam SL, and the 150mm Occam LT. While they're both billed as trail bikes, the SL version has more of a focus on pedaling efficiency (it even has a remote lockout for sprinting on smoother sections of trail), and the LT falls more into the all-mountain side of things, thanks to its slacker head angle and additional travel.Both versions are available with either a carbon or aluminum frame, and the various build kits can be customized using Orbea's MyO program, which has everything from different tire casings to suspension components. Occam Details• Wheel size: 29""• SL: 140mm travel F+R• 65.5° head angle• Remote lockout• LT: 150mm rear travel, 160mm fork• 64.5° or 64° head angle• 440mm chainstays• Sizes: S, M, L, XL• Aluminum & carbon models• MSRP: $3,199 - $10,599 USD• orbea.comFrame DetailsThe SL and LT use the same front triangles and swingarms, so let's start with the features that are the same between the two before going over the differences. The Occam's frame shape isn't drastically different from the previous version – the shock is still mounted to the underside of the top tube, and the asymmetric frame has a brace that runs from the downtube to the middle of the seat tube. As a lefty, I'm a big fan of this design, since it forces the use of a left handed bottle cage. The seatube angle has been steepened slightly, and the tube itself is now free of any kinks or internal obstructions. That means all riders have the option of running a long travel dropper post – even the size small will work with a fully-slammed 230mm post. Both the carbon and alloy models have in-frame storage, so there's no excuse for leaving those gummy bears or beef jerky sticks at home. There's also a handy little multi-tool that sides inside the rocker link pivot, where it's held securely in place by a magnet. The rear axle lever also doubles as a 6mm hex key that can be used for the shock flip chip on the LT model. Other details include fully sealed bearings, a low-profile integrated chainguide, and custom molded chainstay and downtube protection. And yes, the Occam now has thru-headset cable routing, just like the Oiz XC bike and Wild e-bike. Orbea says it's as easy as ever to swap spacers or stems with this system, but that's not entirely true – the stem spacers are split, which means they're much more likely to drop to the shop floor compared to the tried-and-true round spacers. I will give Orbea credit for using a higher quality upper bearing to improve its lifespan, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about this silly design trend. Occam SLThe Occam SL has 140mm of travel front and rear, and uses the same Squidlock remote found on Orbea's XC race bike to simultaneously lock out the fork and shock. The front and rear triangle are the same as the LT model, but the SL forgoes LT's the two-position alloy shock link and instead gets a lighter weight carbon fiber link that's attached to a 210 x 50mm shock.As for the SL designation, the flagship model weighs in at just 24 pounds (10.85 kg). That's an impressive number, especially considering we're in a world where every new bike no matter the category seems to weigh over 30 pounds.Orbea gave the SL what they're calling 'Fast Trail' geometry, which means it has a generous reach of 490mm for a size large, a moderate head angle of 65.5-degrees, and a steep, 78-degree seat tube angle. The chainstays are the same across all four sizes, coming in at 440mm. Build Kits & PricesSL H30: $3,199 USDSL H20: $3,999SL H10: $4,399SL M30: $4,799SL M10: $6,499SL M-LTD: $10,599 Occam LTThe Occam LT has grown longer and slacker, and now has a 160mm fork to go along with its 150mm of rear travel. A flip chip at the rear of the Occam's shock mount makes it possible to change the head angle from 64.5 to 64-degrees, which also drops the bottom bracket height by 8 millimeters. It's compatible with air or coil shocks, and Orbea offers both options in their MyO program. Build Kits & PricesLT H30: $3,599 USDLT H20: $4,399LT M30: $4,999LT M10: $6,499LT M-Team: $8,599Ride ImpressionsThe trail bike category is more expansive than ever, so much so that the term has lost some of its meaning. Categorization may cause heated debates amongst diehard bike nerds, but more than anything it's an indication of just how versatile modern mountain bikes have become. With the new Occam SL and LT, both bikes could be considered trail bikes, but they have distinctly different ride characteristics.Occam SLNow, I'm not going to invent any new categories here (I'll save that task for when the furor over 'downcountry' has fully subsided), but the Occam SL is an interesting model. In all honesty, it's not exactly my cup of tea, although I'm sure there are plenty of riders who will enjoy the blend of stability and sportiness that results from the longer wheelbase and moderate head angle, combined with the ability to lock the fork and shock out for maximum efficiency. It's reasonably light for a 140mm trail bike, too, at 28 pounds (12.7 kg) for the M10 model with a Minion DHF front tire and Dissector rear.Creating two bikes out of one frame isn't usually possible without some sort of compromise, and in the case of the SL it's the longer reach that I noticed. 490 mm is on the longer side for a size large, and while I'd say the overall fit was appropriate for my 5'11” (180cm) height, it does mean that the SL isn't the snappiest handling bike, especially on the tighter, twistier trails where a bike like this would be expected to shine. The steering is fairly quick, but the longer wheelbase means it's not nearly as lively as a bike like the Commencal Tempo, which has the same head angle combined with a shorter reach and a little less rear travel.On higher speed, flowier section of trail the SL is in its element, and I could see it fitting the bill for a rider who wants to cover a lot of ground, but doesn't want the reduced travel and even steeper angles of a dedicated XC bike.Occam LTIf the Occam SL is on one side of the trail bike category, the LT is on the other end of the spectrum, and while I promised I wouldn't make up any new categories, I'm going to revive the all-mountain designation for this model. It may not be able to plow straight through rock gardens without missing a beat the same way some of the recently released high-pivot enduro sleds can, but the flip side is that it's more manageable on mellower terrain, it's quieter on the climbs than those idler-equipped options, and it's still no slouch on the descents. My M10 test bike is currently 33.6 pounds (15.2 kg), and that's with DH-casing tires front and rear (one of the spec options in Orbea's MyO configurator), plus aluminum cranks and wheels – weight-conscious riders could easily reduce the number without taking any drastic measures. After a handful of rides on both models, I'm much more enamored with the LT than the SL – it has good traction without feeling overly stuck to the ground, and the overall ride is very comfortable, free of any harshness. There are similarities to the Specialized Stumpjumper EVO, which makes sense considering how close the geometry numbers are. The updates to the Occam LT help elevate its descending performance, and it's now a bike that could easily be used for long backcountry pedals, the occasional enduro race, or for knocking out after work hot laps.

And what do we think of the current crop?Featuring a rotating cast of the editorial team and other guests, the Pinkbike podcast is a weekly update on all the latest stories from around the world of mountain biking, as well as some frank discussion about tech, racing, and everything in between.Subscribe to the podcast via your preferred service (Apple, Spotify, RSS, Megaphone, etc.), or visit the Pinkbike Podcast tag page for the complete list of episodes.Music CornerAlicia's picks:Henry's picks:Kaz's picks:Editor Eric's pick: 

","Right around the 57 minute mark, Kaz sums up XC (& DC) perfectly...For so much of the world, if you can only have one bike, the shorter travel bike is probably the better option. Add to that, modern XC & DC bikes are so insanely capable and versatile. They can be lightened sufficiently to be pressed into regular racing duty and/or beefed up to handle the chunkier stuff (provided that the rider is willing to exert more input).For me, I come from the age where ""cross-country"" just meant ""mountain biking"". Regardless of whether you raced it, rode it on fire-roads, technical trails, anything and everything in between...you rode a ""mountain bike"". A mountain bike that is closer, from a speciation perspective, to a modern ""cross-country"" bike."

From there we sat down stoked and inspired in the September sun and talked about everything from his new sponsorship deals to the specifics of how his mind works.  In this episode of the podcast we cover:- His mental process from start to finish- How he uses humour to stay grounded and present- Breathwork in riding- How he assesses risk- His specific Visualization strategyAnd so, so, much more.It was truly epic to see Yoann's decision making in real time and I think it highlights the importance of having these conversations and knowing that even the best in the business listen to their 'gut feelings' and say no to features sometimes. See it for yourself below!You can follow Yoann on Instagram @yoannbarelli and YouTube @YoannBarelli and check out his coaching at intothegnar.comListen here or by searching for ‘Grit with Wisdom’ on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Youtube, or over on my website, and you can follow me on Instagram @the_mind_mountainHappy trails - Jake JohnstonePhoto credit: Liam Wallace

Before the Elite riders get between the poles in qualifying here are our thoughts on who could be in the running for a top result in finals.Who has Performed Well Here?The course at Mont-Sainte-Anne always delivers stunning performances in finals as we have witnessed legendary runs over the years including Aaron Gwin's wet weather mastery and Finn Iles's first World Cup win last year. Looking back at the last five races at Mont-Sainte-Anne there have been four elite men's winners, with Loic Bruni the only rider to take more than one win as he came out on top in 2018 and 2019. Loic Bruni has also been incredibly consistent here as he only dropped outside of the top five once in the past five races. Loic's only result outside of the top five in the past five races came last year when he dislocated his shoulder during practice. Also appearing on the top step of the podium in the past five races are Finn Iles, Aaron Gwin and Danny Hart. Finn Iles is one of the four riders competing for the overall, a group featuring Loic Bruni, Loris Vergier and Jackson Goldstone. Looking at these four riders we have three recent MSA winners as Loic has two wins here, Finn one and Jackson picked up the Junior win last year. Jackson's Junior winning run is worth mentioning as while you can't directly compare the results Jackson did set a time good enough for third in elites.For the women we have also seen four winners in five races as Vali Höll, Myriam Nicole, Rachel Atherton and Tahnee Seagrave have stepped onto the top of the podium. Vali Höll also won both of her Junior races here as she was fastest in 2018 and 19. After her strong 2023 season and with three wins here in a row (2018/19 Junior and 2022 Elites) Vali Höll is the best performer on track this weekend. Past winners Myriam Nicole and Rachel Atherton are out this weekend leaving just Tahnee Seagrave as the only other recent winner to be challenging for the win at the final round.2016Elite Women1st.

Bernard Kerr: 4:18.100Check out a quick breakdown of some stats from the last five races at MSA below.Who's Fast in 2023?Heading into the final race of the 2023 season this year's racing continues to be wild as the racing continues to be unpredictable. Seven rounds of racing have so far brought seven winners in the elite men's racing and four for the elite women.As riders head out for the first elite practice session of the week Marine Cabirou carries the most momentum into the last round of the 2023 season as she has secured two back-to-back wins in Les Gets and Snowshoe. Marine is also in a close battle with Nina Hoffmann with just 29 points splitting the riders in the battle for 2nd place overall. Vali Höll has had a tough two races in the second half of the season but with the overall title wrapped, she can now go flat out this weekend with no worries about point scoring. Nina Hoffmann is the only other woman with a win who is racing this weekend and had a tricky time in Snowshoe with a few crashes. Nina ended the weekend in 2nd place but lost a good chunk of points in the overall standings. The men's racing could be some of the best in recent memory as the greasy rocks and roots in Snowshoe brought another new winner as Oisin O'Callaghan topped the podium. So far 2023 has delivered a different winner at each round including five first-time elite World Cup winners. The 2023 constant performers Loic Bruni, Jackson Goldstone and Finn Iles all dropped outside the top 10. The only rider battling for the overall was Loris Vergier who finished the week fourth.

Loic Bruni: 3:20.228Round 7 - SnowshoeElite Women1st. Marine Cabirou: 3:41.0422nd. Nina Hoffmann: 3:41.3863rd. Vali Höll: 3:41.7024th. Tahnee Seagrave: 3:43.8985th. Gloria Scarsi: 3:47.655Elite Men1st. Oisin O Callaghan: 3:07.6242nd. Ronan Dunne: 3:08.1203rd. Dakotah Norton: 3:08.9874th. Loris Vergier: 3:09.3855th. Bernard Kerr: 3:09.422Elite Women's PicksVali HöllOnce again one of our top pick for women's racing is Vali Höll. After winning the overall in Snowshoe Vali has nothing to lose this weekend so expect a flat-out run from the 2023 World and series champion. Tahnee SeagraveTahnee Seagrave has some great results in the past here and after a fourth in Snowshoe Tahnee could be in for another top result this weekend.Marine CabirouFollowing two back-to-back World Cup wins the momentum is on Marine Cabirou's side heading into the final stop of the 2023 series. Marine needs to pick up as many of the possible 250 points as she can because currently, she is only 29 points behind 2nd-placed Nina Hoffmann in the overall standingsElite Men's PicksJackson GoldstoneWe think Jackson Goldstone could take his second elite win this weekend and make it back-to-back Canadian wins at MSA. Jackson has only raced one World Cup at MSA but his Junior winning time in 2022 was good enough for third in elites. As another rider in the fight for the overall a home win and even taking the overall at home would be huge for Jackson.Loic BruniAs the current overall standings leader Loic Bruni has the most to lose this weekend at MSA. Luckily for Loic the track here has been mostly kind to him in past years with multiple wins and top-five finishes. Loic had a big crash during his final run at Snowshoe but we have heard there were no injuries and he is ready to defend his lead.Troy BrosnanLooking back at past results no rider can match the consistency of Troy Brosnan. Since 2016 Troy Brosnan has placed within the top six at every visit to MSA and has been in the top three since 2018. If Troy can continue this run he will end the season with a great result.Honourable MentionsWhile we have made our main predictions for potential winners above there were other riders who we should mention as potential top performers for the final round this weekend. Finn IlesFinn Iles secured an emotional first World Cup win at MSA last year and has the potential to take his first overall title this weekend. To take the overall Finn will need a very strong result so expect him to try to match his 2022 performance.Nina HoffmannNina Hoffmann had a tough week in Snowshoe but she showed her strength with a 2nd place finish at the end of the week. Nina currently sits in 2nd in the overall but will have to fight off a charging Marine Cabiurou to keep this position on Saturday.Who Would You Pick?

That said, I am even more interested in what happens behind the scenes, what goes through the winner's mind as they prepare for the race day, take their race run, and eventually have their run stay standing as the fastest. It was exciting to see Charlie Hatton's preparation pay off this year, plus some of the variables like weather and the venue, leaving Charlie wearing the rainbow stripes when the weekend ended. Unfortunately, Charlie is now taking a bit of time off the bike to recover from an injured arm and wrist, but we can be sure he'll be back stronger. In the meantime, we still have a lot to talk about and lots to celebrate - Atherton Bikes has even released a limited edition bike that replicates Charlie's winning machine to commemorate the moment. It looks like things will really keep improving from here, despite the inevitable injury setback. I caught up with Charlie to hear about his World Champs success, what that means for his expectations for himself going forward, and how World Cup racing feels for him right now during this transitional season. I really enjoyed talking with him; I hope you enjoy the read. Charlie, congrats on your recent victory at World Champs. How does it feel to settle into that?Well, firstly, thank you very much. To be honest, it still not sunk in. I think there’s like small moments where I have a bit of realization and yeah, it feels absolutely insane to be honest. And yeah, it's a day that I'll definitely never forget. Yeah, that sounds like the coolest thing to remember at random. Can you walk me through your race day at Fort William and how you felt waking up, how you prepared for your race run, and then how that felt to realize you were going to become the next World Champ?Waking up on race day, I was feeling fairly confident. I had a good qualifying run. I was sixth place and the times were super close, so yeah, I knew a good result was achievable. Maybe not a gold medal, but yeah, that bit exceeded my expectations I guess. But yeah, woke up in the morning feeling pretty nervous, but pretty confident at the same time. It was quite a weird feeling. Yeah. I struggled to eat my breakfast actually, so I was just like pushing some food around the plate, just like, ""Come on Charlie, eat something."" And then as soon as I got to the track, I just relaxed and me and Andi [Kolb] went up and did some runs. I did two runs in the morning and the track was really good in the morning. We had a little bit of rain overnight, but it was fairly dry still. And then, yeah, those two practice runs went really well, just ticked off what I needed to get done really.And then finals came around and it started to rain, so I was actually pretty stoked. I know Fort William really well. I know it rides really good in the wet, so I just thought, ""Right, you can still ride it as if it was dry."" So that was my mindset and my mentality going into that run. And yeah, I was in a really good place mentally. I think going into it, I wasn't nervous. I was quite excited really to get stuck into it. I had a bit of a game plan for the actual run itself. I knew sections that are going to work well in the wet, and I knew sections like the woods, for example, that were going to be a bit more tricky. So I was sort of like a bit of survival mode through there, and then I knew at the bottom I'd start to hammer the pedals. So yeah, that was my strategy going into the run, and I think, yeah, it paid off pretty good. That's cool that you managed to ride it as if it were dry or at least go in with that mindset. Did you have to make any modifications to your bike and gear setup or are you always ready because you're British?Yeah, definitely always ready. These conditions we ride in the winter all the time, so I would say I ride in the wet – I definitely ride in the wet a lot more than I ride in the dry. So yeah, when we get a dry condition, I'm almost out of my comfort zone, so it's opposite to a lot of people.We definitely made some modifications to the bike and gear. We did some things to the brake because Fort William, you're actually not on the brakes that much at the top. And when it's cold and wet, the brakes actually get really cold, so we put some stuff over the caliper to keep the heat in the break and stop the water getting in.  It was raining a lot. So that kept the brakes working really good. I had obviously some roll offs, which were essential in those conditions. We did things like I had a peak extension. So Bell actually make this really cool visor that goes over the top of your peak and it molds around the current visor and this gives you an extra probably three inches of a clear lens almost on the top that just helps with the rain not going onto your goggles. So yeah, that helped. And also an extra long mudhugger I put on which helped. So yeah, all these little things definitely help out. Yeah, it's kind of cool that once you get to the level of performance where you are, it seems like you get down to the really fine details making a huge difference. And yeah, that's kind of cool just to see. Did you have to make any changes to your mental approach to the race or did you just approach it as normal racing and it happened to be wet?Yeah, I think I approach every race the same, really as always going in and giving it 110%. But yeah, I was definitely felt more comfortable being that track and those conditions. I think I definitely put my mind at ease, and I know I can go fast on that track, so it was just telling myself that you can do it really and yeah, just got to lay down a good run. And yeah, it definitely paid off. Yeah, well now the rest of the world also knows you can go fast on that track, so it worked out. Are you someone who kind of sticks to a rigid routine on race day or did you do anything differently at World Champs?No, I try and stick to exactly the same routine at every race, to be honest. I think familiarity is something that is definitely something that you need on a race. I don't think you want to be changing things up or trying new things on a race. I think once you've got things pretty set and dialed, I try and stick pretty much to the same routine every week. And I guess, ""If it's not broken, don't fix it,"" I think is a good motto. I like that. It seems to be working out. What did you learn from the World Champs race?I learned a lot, to be honest. I think mentally now going into other races is sort of like, ""Well, you can do it, you have done it before so why can't you do it again?"" It feels like I've been on the cusp of a result... Maybe not like this, but maybe a podium at a World Cup or things like that, so it was nice to sort of finally get it done. I was telling myself like, ""I know that good results coming, but I've just got to be patient..."" That makes a lot of sense. Once you have familiarity with what works, why change it?Yeah, definitely, 100%. I think you've got to try and find a routine that works for you and stick to it, but I guess I've been racing World Cups for... Well, it seems like a long time, but it's actually not that long. How long have you been racing World Cups?This will be, I guess since 2015 was my first Junior World Cup, so eight years, which... Yeah, I guess it's a long time, but for some of the older guys I guess it's not long at all. For sure. Yeah. How long have you been in the Elites?Elite? Since 2017, so six years now. What would you say are strengths and weaknesses when it comes to racing?Strengths? I'd say, probably the more technical, slower, sometimes when it's wet, probably that sort of suits my riding style a lot more, I'd say. And when it's really fast... Not simple, but almost one line that you've just got to really risk at all. I'm not very good at that. I think a track like Andorra, I quite struggle with that sort of riding, just riding on the absolute limit and everyone's on the same sort of line. Yeah, I struggle with that. Do you think that comes from being a British rider and being raised in the wet technical stuff?Yeah, definitely. I think being from the UK, we normally... We have quite small hills, so if we make them fast and straight, they'll only be 30 seconds long, so we normally try to make them a bit tighter technical just to get the most out of the hill. Which is really good for some things, but then other things, it's a bit of a disadvantage I think. Sure, that makes sense. What are the most important parts of your training?Most important part of my training... I don't know, that's a tough one. I think everything combined makes for one good package, but if I was to just do one thing, I think it would just be probably riding my downhill bike. I think you can train in the gym, you can be the strongest man in the world. It doesn't mean you're going to go faster down the hill. So yeah, I think the downhill bike is definitely the most important thing. Now, kind of looking forward into the rest of your season, what does being World Champion do to your expectations for yourself, and how do you make sense of that with still being a racer who shows up and competes with everyone else every weekend? Or many weekends.Yeah, I think it's really tough actually. I think after winning Worlds, it was a big change in a lot of aspects really. I've been way more busy with doing things I guess like this, and I obviously was doing stuff like this before, but yeah, it's a lot more frequent now. And I think wearing the jersey definitely adds, maybe not pressure, but... Yeah, it does add a little bit of pressure and expectation to do well, but I think on the other hand, it also is a really good way of just saying, ""Well, I have done it before, so there's no reason why I can't do it again, I guess."" So, yeah, I've just got to try and remind myself. Yeah, you mentioned that earlier too. It seems like such an important part of the process to realize that you're someone who's genuinely capable of riding down the hill fastest, and that's so cool. And as long as you can stay healthy with that and not cave to the expectation, it seems like potentially really awesome and really motivating.Yeah, it's definitely motivating and yeah, I guess it can work both ways. It's just you've got to try and channel the right emotions at the right time, I guess, which is, yeah, definitely tough. When I first put the jersey on in Andorra for my qualifying run, I thought, ""Wow, actually..."" It was the first time I've actually put it on. So yeah, I was a bit like, ""Oh."" How does it feel to wear it?Yeah, absolutely insane. When I look down and just see the stripes. Yeah, it's pretty incredible. Wow, that's so cool.Yeah, it is a special feeling, definitely. Do you have goals for yourself for the rest of the season?To be honest, I think... Yeah, I've ticked off an absolute huge goal and I think now I've just got to try and almost enjoy it, enjoy wearing the jersey until next year and who knows, maybe next year I could do it, but we'll see. Yeah, it's just go enjoy it I think, and yeah, just try and ride as I would before and just give it a 100%. Yeah, that's sweet. You sort of answered this with just saying enjoy it, and do you have goals for your future as a rider? Since World Champ is sort of a lifetime goal for many, many people who will never get there, and it's incredible that you got there already. What are you hoping to do next?Yeah, for me it was quite a big stepping stone really. I was like a top ten rider, so for me to then win World Champs, it was quite a big jump. So I think I've still got a lot of things I'd like to achieve really. I haven't actually had a World Cup podium yet, so I guess I've got to try and get one of them. And then who knows, maybe win a World Cup. Yeah, I think to be honest, just have fun with it and keep giving it a 100%. I think that's the best way to approach it. What's it like being part of the Atherton team? You've been with them so long, it seems like a cool progression.Yeah, it's been insane. Well, from the start of Atherton Bikes actually... Yeah, it's been really cool to grow with the bike and the brand and I think for me, I've learned so much about the actual bike setup because before I'd just get on a bike and ride it, to be honest. And now being with these guys, they've taught me so much. And now I could tell you every single measurement on my bike, I could tell you even for future bikes, what size, everything I'd want it to be, what geometry and... Yeah, I think it's definitely improved me as a rider, but definitely more of a well-rounded package, you could say. How did you first get involved?We got involved after 2017. It was my first year in Elite and I had some... It was like my rookie season I guess you could say, and I came in, had some good results. And then had an email from Dan Brown, the team manager at the time. Yeah, I guess just went from there and had a few more meetings with them, and I just thought this was a good decision really to go with these guys. What's it like being part of the Atherton family crew? It seems like also you get the bikes, but then you also get access to this whole world of racing and really cool mentorship.Yeah, definitely. I think obviously growing up looking almost idolizing Gee, Rach, and Dan, yeah, they're absolutely insane riders and super successful. I think, they're like proper athletes. Yeah, I think for me to go into that environment was really, really good and I learned so much. How do you feel about where downhill racing is right now with the new formatting?At the minute, I think it's going in the right direction. I think it's becoming a lot more mainstream, which is cool. But yeah, today we've had a bit of a problem with the juniors not getting to race because the weather conditions were bad. That's the first time that's happened in a long time.I think that's a bit of a shame, really. Yeah, I think it was obviously a tough call on their side. They obviously had other reasonings than just the weather. I guess, you've got to think as the marshal's up on the hill, you've got to think there could be a thunderstorm rolling in at any time, so there's more than it just looks, I think. Yeah, they've definitely got a tough job and trying to keep everyone happy, it's definitely not easy. I think it's going in the right direction and yeah, it's good. Do you think it's realistic to have three timed runs for each rider – qualifying, semifinals, and finals – every time? It seems like a lot of racing, but also potentially cool if you guys can all handle it.Yeah, it's a tough one, I think. At the start of the year, we had like Lenzerheide, Leogang and they were slightly shorter tracks. And to be honest, I thought the semi and everything worked really well. I didn't really see it as an issue, but if the tracks are actually longer like say Val di Sole, I think by the end of the weekend you could see some of the riders were getting pretty tired and it looked a little bit sketchy. But yeah, I'm not sold on the semi-final idea yet. I don't think it's bad, but I also don't think it's great sort of on the fence. That honestly sounds kind of like how I feel about it like, we'll see. It might be cool, might be hard. We'll find out. So thinking about all the other riders out there who really look up to you, what's the best piece of advice that you have for up-and-coming riders who want to pursue racing?I think this is very cliche, but you've got to enjoy riding your bike. I don't think you'd want to go out and think, ""Oh, when am I going to get on a big team? When am I going to get sponsorship?"" I think that sort of comes when it comes, and I wouldn't put pressure on that side of things. I think if you're enjoying riding your bike and you're having fun at the races and things like that... Yeah, I think that the good results will almost come from that. Yeah, if it's meant to be, it will be. And yeah, it's definitely not easy getting to be a top downhiller, but if you just almost, again cliche, but sort of trust the process, I think it's definitely possible.Charlie, thanks so much for taking the time to chat and share your insight into this incredible win and your racing future. It's great to catch a glimpse of life behind the scenes for our new World Champion, and I'm sure I'm not the only one excited to see what you do in the future.

The pedals are SPD-compatible, and they run the gamut from a 336 gram XC-oriented model with a composite body to a trail-style pedal with a mid-size aluminum platform around the clip-in mechanism. All of the pedals have 7-degrees of float, plus adjustable spring tension. The XC options receive the Kovee model name, and the larger-platformed trail pedals are under the Line model name. All of the pedals spin on sealed bearings and chromoly spindles. My initial impressions are that the weights and prices are all in the reasonable realm, and my first few rides on the Line Elite pedals have been free of any surprises. The entry and exit is smooth, and I was able to find my ideal tension level without any fuss. I'll see how they hold up to a few months of sloppy conditions and report back.More info: trekbikes.com

84,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/commencal-ramones-cool-bikes-make-happy-kids.html,Commencal Release Ramones Kids Bike Collection - Pinkbike,A new range of bikes for the little rippers.," PRESS RELEASE: Commencal Bikes Big kids (like us) and little ones alike will be excited by our new and updated Ramones Kids range. Not only do we have new colours but also totally redesigned frames for the 20 and 24-inch models. Made to fit their small size and body shape, the aim is to provide them with the best early learning experience possible in the world of mountain biking. Thanks to our knowledge and experience making bikes for adults we took to the drawing board and designed the Ramones to meet the requirements and different skill levels of the youngest riders. Taking everything into consideration and to cover all bases we ended up with a total of 6 bikes in the range, all varying not only by wheel size, but also standover height. The Ramones range starts with the lightest (4.5kg) 12 and 14-inch push bikes, which are perfect to work on balance and build confidence. They are followed by 14 and 16-inch first ‘real’ mountain bikes, equipped with beefy tires and an ergonomic cockpit. Once they have mastered their balance, these larger bikes will make the pedalling learning process easier and will enable them to discover their first real trails, the pump track and jumps in total safety.For taller and more experienced kids we offer the Ramones 20 and Ramones 24-inch, both with totally redesigned frames for more manoeuvrability and a fresh look. With a view to progressing, these models feature a 15mm thru-axle fork, wide tires for comfort and more stability, disc brakes with smaller levers, and a 7-gear drivetrain. Check out more HERE 

","Best push bike, in my opinion. My almost 3 year old has a 12”. It has disc tabs and a platform to put his feet on. I pulled off the stock brake because it was hard to pull and too far off the lever. I put on a short pull BB7 road caliper, a Stacyc brake lever body, an ASV lever with adjustable reach, hope rotor, and Shimano cable/housing. It now has about 5mm of lever pull to full lock (and it’s powerful) with almost no lever pull resistance.Yeah, i spent almost as much on the brake setup as I did on the bike itself, but my little dude can actually stop. It would be hard to reduce the total lever throw on a hydraulic brake, but the BB7 has the ability to turn in both brake pads individually to get them super close to the rotor, which reduces total lever throw.When he’s on a bigger bike with a front brake, I’ll do the same thing on the front, but then change where the cable is clamped at the caliper to reduce the leverage ratio, which will prevent the ability to lock the front wheel completely while he’s still learning. There really isn’t anyone making tiny-hand specific brakes, so for anyone wondering what to do, here you go.For anyone who says “there’s no market for fancy kids bike stuff” or “it’s stupid to make a carbon strider for $1k”, you need to remember that there are plenty of people who will shell out for that stuff. My kid loves his bike, and riding with him and seeing that pure joy has no dollar value."

The outgoing rider seems to have found ways to combine all his passions, with social media as a major outlet alongside his passions for riding itself, coaching, and environmentalism. He started Into the Gnar to run short-term and long-term coaching programs to help riders reach their goals. He also started the Tour de Gnar, a somewhat grassroots yet renowned freeride event during which riders are invited to spend a summer day tackling all the gnarliest features in the Sea to Sky zone, one of the burliest riding destinations in the world.Mountain biking also aligns nicely with Yoann's interest in sustainability, and teaming up with Devinci will help support that. Devinci has been working on refining its aluminum manufacturing, resulting in lower emissions, and Yoann will be riding bikes made in Canada from Canadian raw materials.Devinci's commitment to reducing its environmental footprint by making bikes in Quebec resonates deeply with me. Preserving our natural playgrounds is a shared passion. And as a francophone company, Devinci's connection to my French roots adds a special dimension to this journey. I'm super pumped to be part of the family and honored to ride the Chainsaw, a bike with a strong meaning and heritage to many riders and me. Joining Devinci is more than sponsorship, it's a meaningful connection  —Yoann BarelliAs a quick editorial note from Alicia, Yoann finishing his official business announcement with a typographic emoji smiley face, just, makes so much sense. He's Yoann Barelli. He can be both professional and highly personal at the same time, the exact attitude that's drawn the wildman down gnarly slabs and into the freeride edits. We love to see it.We at Pinkbike wish both Yoann and Devinci all the best in this new partnership, and we look forward to seeing what comes next. We can be sure it will be worth watching.

Here is everything you need to know ahead of the 2023 XC World Cup's eighth and final round.Race BriefingAfter seven hectic rounds of racing, we are finally at the last stop of the 2023 XC World Cup series with riders making the trip from Snowshoe to the legendary Mont-Sainte-Anne. With a mixed week of weather, the rocky course is going to provide one final technical challenge in 2023. Looking back at previous winners here it is Nino Schurter, Jolanda Neff and Catherine Pendrel who have achieved victory more than three times. Nino Schurter is carrying plenty of momentum into this weekend after playing a smart race in Snowshoe where he was able to last a late attack to catch Jordan Sarrou but fell just short in a sprint to take 2nd. Nino's power is clearly there and he is a top performer on this course. Jolanda Neff is another Swiss rider who goes very well here winning in 2014, 2015, 2018 and 2022. Jolanda Neff made it into the top five last weekend and will be wanting to end her year with a record-breaking fifth win at MSA.Heading into the final round the women's elite standings are wrapped up as Puck Pieterse has built an insurmountable lead over Mona Mitterwallner to take the 2023 overall champ title. There is still a close battle for 2nd and with 280 points on the line this weekend six riders are mathematically in the running. The six riders are Mona Mitterwallner, Loana Lecomte, Alessandra Keller, Laura Stigger, Martina Berta and Evie Richards. Pauline Ferrand Prevot is technically in this points range but she is now racing this weekend as she is defending her title at the Gravel World Championships.The elite men's title is still very much undecided as we have four riders who could potentially clinch the overall lead. Nino Schurter currently holds a healthy lead of 89 points against last weekend's winner Jordan Sarrou but with 280 points on offer and wet weather potentially creating carnage this lead could quickly dispaear. Also with potential for the overall win are Mathias Flückiger and Luca Schwarzbauer. We hope that helps get you up to speed for this weekend's racing. Keep scrolling to gather more details to get you ready for round seven of the 2023 XC World Cup series in Mont-Sainte-Anne.What Happened at the Last Round?After the spectacle of the downhill racing the U23 and Elite XCO races carried on the hype as we witnessed four incredible races with riders pushing the limits on the greasy Snowshoe course. The U23 Men kicked off the day of racing as Carter Woods and Adrien Boichis kept the speeds high as they were unmatched at the front of the race. Adrien Boichis tried to topple Carter Woods in the final lap but after two failed attacks it was the Canadian rider who powered ahead to cross the line 15 seconds ahead. Next up was the U23 Women and once again Samara Maxwell delivered a dominant performance taking the lead in lap two and never looking back. Samara piloted her new Rocrider race bike to the top step of the podium with Ronja Blöchlinger crossing the line over a minute back. The top five riders were split by a huge four minutes and 19 seconds.Laura Stigger was unstoppable in Snowshoe as she created a six-second gap on lap two before riding away from the chasing group to secure her first World Cup XCO win. Laura Stigger rode a near-perfect race to master the tough course and stay ahead of challenges from the world's best. Loana Lecomte tried her best to close the gap with the margin shrinking to just 16 seconds at the mid-point on the final lap, but it would prove just too much as the French racer settled for 2nd place. Martina Berta was at the sharp end for all six laps as she wrapped up the penultimate round of the season in third.What a ride from Jordan Sarrou as he fended off attacks throughout the race before winning a final showdown against Nino Schurter to win in Snowshoe. Jordan Sarrou played a smart race as he remained close to the front allowing him to charge past Luca Schwarzbauer when he punctured on lap five. Jordan faced a last-lap battle but came out victorious for his first win in 2023. Nino Schurter had a great day in 2nd as he led a trio of Swiss racers filling out the top four.Elite Women:1st.

The real twist in the tale was mid-way through the women's race when a storm front passed through, unleashing a deluge on the track and turning things on their head. It was the perfect storm for Jolanda Neff though who, unsurprisingly, felt at home in the slick conditions and rode to her first World Cup win for four years. Mona Mitterwallner climbed up the rankings from deep in the back after a sprint with Haley Batten over second and third with the Austrian just sneaking ahead, Martina Berta and Haley Batten rounded out the podium places. The men were faced with a slick but drying track, it would be a hard race to read given the conditions but one man mastered them better than everyone. Titouan Carod took his first World Cup win with a brutally ferocious ride, finishing over a minute and a half ahead of his teammate Filippo Colombo who managed to outfox David Valero Serrano, Luca Braidot, Pierre De Froidmont and Nino Schurter in the final meters.Elite Women (5 Laps)1st.

95,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/first-look-gasgas-ecc-emtb.html,GasGas Launches ECC eMTB with WP / DVO Suspension - Pinkbike,Coming soon to your local powersports shop.," In keeping with their moto roots, GasGas has released a brand-new eMTB that draws from their experience in the powersports world and highlights some of the freshest e-bike tech on the market today. Dubbed the ECC, this new E-enduro bike was a collaborative effort between GasGas, the Kiska design group, with suspension help from WP and DVO. All models feature the new SRAM Powertrain drive unit, and a unique carbon frame.ECC geometry.The geometry of the ECC is progressive, even amongst other modern e-mtbs. With size-specific chainstays that are a fair bit longer than the average, very high stack heights, and fairly long reach numbers, the bike will certainly have a large footprint. That said, the head and seat angles aren't very extreme, at 64° and 75°, respectively. The size Small has a slightly steeper STA, but overall that detail feels a little bit off the mark, compared to the 77/78° angles we're starting to see more regularly. Luckily, you have a massive motor to do the climbing for you, so realistically that body position matters a bit less than on pedal bikes.Speaking of the motor, it's the Powertrain model we covered last week, with 90Nm of peak power and a very simple user interface. The ECC comes with a 600Wh battery, which they see as the ideal combination of weight and power. In classic moto fashion, the bike comes with removable and customizable plastics, to help protect the carbon frame and help contribute to that braap braap aesthetic. The suspension developed for this bike is a very interesting detail, as it is WP's first foray into mountain bike components. WP is a well-known brand in the moto world, but hadn't down-sized their tech until now. Partnering with DVO, they've integrated some novel damping techniques. The main feature here is a cone valve that acts as a blow-off on hard impacts, without affecting the regular damping circuits. That valve can be adjusted externally via the HSC damping, with independent LSC and rebound accessible externally. This isn't necessarily a radical departure from typical fork/shock technologies, but could help keep the ride height high in the travel without sacrificing small bump and large compression performance. GasGas dealers should have available models by the end of 2023, with North American availability coming in the spring of 2024. More info at gasgas.com

The 1Zero HiTop wheels have a unique rim profile that was designed with compliance in mind, in order to create a quick and comfortable wheelset for XC racing or general lighter-duty trail riding. There are two versions, the HiTop SW and the HiTop S. Both use the same rim, but the SW model has lighter hubs and spokes, and it comes with the TyreWiz 2.0 tire pressure monitoring system. Claimed weight for the SW is 1325 grams, and the S is reported to weigh in at 1495 grams, although on my scale the SW wheels came in at 1361 grams, and that's without the TyreWiz valves or Centerlock lockring installed. The wheels are light in the grand scheme of things, but for an XC wheelset they're not that light – for comparison, Roval's Control SL wheels are 1240 grams, and Bontrager's Kovee wheels are 1199 grams. 1Zero HiTop SW• Wheel size: 29""• Intended use: XC / light trail• Hub: ZM2 SL hub, 66 points of engagement• TyreWiz 2.0 included• Weight: 1325 grams (claimed) / 1361 grams actual (without valve stems or Centerlock lockring)• Lifetime warranty• Price: $1925 USD1Zero HiTop S• Wheelsize: 29""• Hub: ZM 900 SL, 52 points of engagement• Weight: 1495 grams• Lifetime warranty• Price: $1350 USD• sram.com/en/zippThe carbon rim's shape doesn't look as out-there as the very low profile of the single-wall 3Zero Moto rims due to the use of a more typical box-style construction. The top of the rim does flare out slightly, a shape that's intended to help prevent pinch flats, since there's less of an edge for the tire to get folded over during an impact. Each rim wall is 3.85mm wide at the top, and the inner rim width is 30mm. The rim depth is 21.2mm. As for pricing, the SW wheels are $1,925 USD for the set, or $1,025 for the rear wheel and $925 for the front. The S wheels are $1,350, $725 for the rear wheel and $625 for the front. Both wheelsets are made in Taiwan, and are covered by a lifetime warranty.Initial ImpressionsI've only been able to squeeze in a handful of rides in on the HiTop wheels so far, so a longer term durability assessment will have to wait. On the trail, they feel decidedly like an XC wheelset – there's a zippiness to them (no pun intended) that you won't find from a heavier set of trail or enduro wheels. They're certainly not uncomfortably stiff, although they also aren't as soft-feeling as those 3Zero Moto wheels were. I did get a few twangs out of the spokes when pushing hard into corners, and I'd recommend abiding by Zipp's recommendation that these are best suited to bikes with 130mm of travel or less. Those 24 spokes can only do so much, and when things get really fast and rough the wheels can start to feel undergunned.If I was trying to decide between the SW or the S wheels I'd likely go with the S version. Yes, they're heavier, but they also have 6-bolt hubs instead of Centerlock, and they don't come with TyreWiz 2.0. I know, I know, someone spent a lot of time developing that tire pressure monitoring system, I just still can't get behind adding another battery powered gadget to a bike when I already check my tire pressure before every ride. Look for a follow-up report once we get some more miles in on these wheels, including some back-to-back laps in against other competitors in this category.  

",I won’t be buying any SRAM wheels until SpokeWiz can monitor tension so that NipTender can adjust it on the fly.

With an epic fourth day to close a loop around the Maladetas massif and the highest peack in the Pyrenees, the Aneto. Four days to complete 130km, +5000m of climb with lots of hike-a-bike and +10000m descent through some of the best trails the central spanish Pyrenees has to offer. Long flowy meadows, forest with plenty of roots, rocky alpine mountain passes and lot more. And on top of that, blind racing, what else you need?Epic fourth and last day of race brought the riders to the highest point of the race, the Vallibierna mountain pass at 2800m high, with a long hike-a-bike first liason to get there. From that point on, five timed stages awaited the participants to get a total of 2417m of descent. The struggle was real with ane early wake up for everyone on a 4.5km liason to gain 700m of elevation. Afterwards a short quick first stage, another short climb and then three timed stages in a row, Estibafreda, Picalbo and La Mina to get down to Cerler to have a quick break, get some food and drink and finish up with a long fifth stage with the legendary trails Colungele plus Planadona. Not for the faint hearted for sure.The battle was fierce on the women category with swiss Anja Horkova and german Simone Vogel switching the overall position on a daily basis. But it was Anja who digged deep after a huge crash on the third day and managed to get back the lost time and put some extra time between her and the german rider to finish on top of the overall with 00:55.27s difference. Third on fourth day was Lena Kaiser but as she couldn't race second day it was Eva Carrer who got the third place overall.The men category was all in for Alex Medina, winner of 16 stages out of a total of 18 and with a total difference over Pablo Moreno, his closest competitor, of 04:43s. Third on the day and the overall was slovenian Nace Vovk 07:19.74s behind Alex Medina.The most awaited result was on the ebikes category with Orbea riders Damien Oton and Gabriel Torralba separated by 22s at the start of the last day and with Gabriel Torralba having won the three previous days. But Damien ""El Zorro"", the Fox, had yet much to say. He won every stage of the last day and with enough time to get him on top of the overall podium with Gabriel Torralba second at 00:26.42s. It is the third Trans-Nomad for Gabi and the long-awaited victory continues to slip through the fingers. This is Trans-Nomad, cycloalpinism at its best.

When he joined the MOB in January 2023, he was already recovering from a serious injury. Unfortunately, his luck worsened, and in March this year ahead of the first Enduro World Cup, his world was turned upside down as he sustained a Grade 5 Spleen injury.   The YT MOB has been fully committed to Kasper, providing the best possible support to ensure a strong recovery, and that he returns to racing at the right time. The last five months have seen Kasper working hard with MOB Performance Manager, Jonny Thompson, to build strength and fitness before returning to race the final two World Cups in France.   The recovery process has been really slow. Having to basically start from scratch on my fitness and riding was difficult and made it easy to doubt myself. It was very tough mentally, but about seven months in, I started to feel good on the bike, and the confidence started to come back.—Kasper Woolley, MOB Enduro Athlete Having a performance manager has been a crucial part of the program. It made my recovery much smoother, allowing me to come back to a high level of racing when I felt ready. Having that connection to the team was really positive mentally, and that is huge when going through a big recovery. Having someone focused on your race day performance is such an asset to the team.—Kasper Woolley, MOB Enduro Athlete Kasper rounded his albeit short season with some excellent stage results in Chatel for the final Enduro World Cup.  It felt great to come back with an 11th place in Chatel. I was really close to my top ten goal for that race. Getting a 3rd and 4th place stage result was the highlight for me, showing myself that I can still be at the front. It just gives me a lot of motivation going into this off-season.—Kasper Woolley, MOB Enduro AthleteInjuries are part of the game, they’re never easy and never good. I see it as our job to navigate and support our riders through the dark moments, the same as we celebrate with them when winning. I’m proud to see how Kasper returned, and can only of wished for the season to be longer. He demonstrated that the pace is there and showed he’s hungry for more.—Jan-Philipp ‘JP’ Becker, Director Brand Marketing YT Industries

Starting with our first prototype mule, the VT-01. By sending our athletes Kyle Strait, Joe Smith, and Callum Morris to some of the world's biggest downhill races and freeride events, we’re going to learn, test, and develop ideas that will guide our future mountain bike design.There’s no deadline, no launch date, and we’re probably not going to make any money. But what we will do is gather learnings that only this type of real-world testing can provide, and pass on any performance benefits to the real, everyday riders who ride our bikes. Design Engineer, Orlando Appleby, had been working on what we are now calling the VT-01 (VT for Vitus, 01 because it’s the first prototype) as a passion project. When Vitus began speaking with Kyle Strait about coming on board, the development team was floored with the details and introspection Kyle offered in bike setup and development. We knew Kyle was more than a rider, he was a partner for the whole team. Vitus has the engineering talent in house, and with a swath of skilled riders — including Hardline podium alumni Joe Smith and Callum Morris — to support, it was time to show off just how committed we are to the process and our athletes. Episode one kicks off with Vitus athletes Kyle and Callum spending a day testing with Orlando and Product Manager, Ben Irwin, and R&D Engineer, Chris Brown, at the test tracks near Vitus HQ in Northern Ireland. The next day, the team heads to the Belfast office to discuss the origins of this latest prototype as well as walk through the process every Vitus bike goes through before landing at your local trail. Callum Morris is a young, up-and-coming rider itching to make it on the World Cup Downhill circuit. Kyle Strait has been a professional racer and rider since before Cal was born and has more riding experience than most will see in their lifetime. Vitus seeks input from all points on the spectrum when it comes to creating a bike. Mash that intel with our own team’s tenacity for getting loose on the trails and the result is a winner. Dig in and enjoy all the gritty details, then make sure to stay tuned for future episodes. Next stop: Joe Smith and Kyle Strait take on Red Bull Hardline!

103,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/guerrilla-gravity-appears-to-have-closed-up-shop.html,Guerrilla Gravity Appears to Have Closed Up Shop - Pinkbike,Murky news all seems to point in one direction.," Questions about Guerrilla Gravity’s future started circulating back in July, when Yoann Barelli shared an Instagram post reminiscing fondly about his time representing the Colorado brand for the last 2.5 years. The split seemed odd considering the mid-year timing plus the clearly affectionate relationship that stayed in place.What seems to be happening is that Guerrilla Gravity is shutting down, probably unexpectedly. A source with knowledge of Guerrilla Gravity who would like to stay anonymous told Pinkbike that the angel investor(s) who had been supporting the brand previously decided to pull out and shut the company down. September 1 seems to have been Guerrilla Gravity’s last day.As to what exactly happened, we really don't have much besides a vague understanding here. A few of us have reached out to various parties at GG, but no comment seems to be the comment of the day. From what we've gathered, the primary funding source behind the brand has been lost, and as a result production had to cease.It seems as though Revved Industries - Guerrilla Gravity's parent company - is still operational, so it's possible that we'll still see something come of the novel carbon fiber manufacturing process that they've pioneered. It was a promising concept, with solid social and environmental gains made over traditional carbon manufacturing techniques. That said, money talks and it's possible that bike manufacturing just wasn't the ticket to success. Employees on social media do seem to be confirming the company’s end. Plus, the brand’s marketing manager – who would probably be the person in charge of creating a public statement – seems to have departed around the same time as Barelli, so that might be our easiest explanation for the radio silence. There also hasn't been any activity on the company's Instagram page for over six weeks.GG's CTO announced his departure from the company via a LinkedIn post, with some earnest memories about the early days and benchmarks of the 10+ years of operation. I'm hoping all the talented folks who spent time at the company can find a place that feels like home in the industry, as we will all benefit from more creative energy in the bike world.Reception to this news has been mixed so far, especially without a clear sense of how exactly things are going to wrap up. Riders are sad to see the brand go. Frustration is directed at both the former investors and at the brand itself: now many riders will be stuck without ongoing support from the brand they bought serious goods from.Regardless of what exactly the future holds, it seems safe to say we won’t see Guerrilla Gravity carry on in the same ways as before, and losing a unique brand that was happy to forge their own path is a loss for the industry. Condolences from us here at Pinkbike, we'll be watching curiously to see what happens with Revved in the future for carbon manufacturing. As for product support, order fulfillment, and spare parts for the many Guerrilla Gravity owners out there, we'll just have to stay tuned and see how things shake out. 

","Former GG/Revved Employee here. Most of this information is true with a couple minor errors. Revved and GG were basically one company all along. Both were under one roof and employees all worked together on a day to day basis. Revved was created to allow us to make parts for other OEMs. Both companies were officially done as of last Friday (9/29). The companies are for sale. Go buy them if you have the money. All employees saw that the end was near. There were four rounds of layoffs that began in February. The company was a blast to work at and I would never trade that experience. We had our growing pains, but we made the best of it. I love my GG bikes, the community, and the experience I gained from my time with them. Go hire an ex GG/Revved employee and I’m sure you won’t be disappointed. Ride your bike and pour one out for a cool company that had great potential."

Once again, we returned to Grožnjan in the north-west of the Istria peninsula, just 15 kilometres from Slovenia into Croatia – it is the first year after over three decades that the border actually no longer exists. If there was anything wrong the past weekend, it was too hot on the climbs and the trails too dusty. But who could complain about that on the first of October? Otherwise, we're sure everyone will sign up to just put it in the rules that the final MUST be hosted by BBK Grožnjan.In the seventh and last race of the season (the eighth was the national championship, which for the first time did not count for points) 255 riders from six countries lined up for the start. Four special stages with about 1100 vertical metres of climbs and descents awaited them on the long course, with the e-bike category having an additional one. The short course participants raced in three stages, while the U13 category raced in two.Ivartnik's second victoryDavid Ivartnik (Golovec Trails), number two in the overall standings, led the men's long course race with wins on the first two stages. In the last two he finished third, not too far behind, and the total was enough for his second win in the SloEnduro series. The first time was two years ago in Kočevje.Behind David it was a tough fight for second place. The third stage, the Spar Online SuperStage and also the longest in the race on the Pertići track, which has been renovated and is back in the race, was won by the national downhill champion Luka Berginc (DH Visit Pohorje), who tried his hand in SloEnduro for the second time this year. In the fourth and last stage, Nejc Huth (Energijateam.com) was the fastest, having missed the previous race and was eager to break back onto the podium of the overall standings. In the end, Huth earned second place, just four hundredths faster than Berginc at a race time of almost 12 and a half minutes!Fourth place went to Miha Smrdel (MBK Črni Vrh) and fifth to Jan Markič (ŠKTD Avče).Smrdel's third titleSmrdel did not have his best day, finishing fifth and three times fourth on the stages. But even that was more than enough for his third consecutive SloEnduro title. This year he won the first two races (Kamplc and Borovci), was second in Gorjanci and now fifth, but missed Cilenca and Krokar. One worst result for each rider was deducted anyway.The second place in the overall standings was confirmed by Ivartnik's victory, while the third place was defended by Jernej Kavčič (MBK Črni Vrh), the winner of Krokar, who was sixth this time. He finished the season just 10 points clear of the fourth-placed Huth.New women's winnerTina Smrdel (MBK Črni Vrh) arrived in Grožnjan with her second title in the women's category already in her pocket. On Saturday she was still training on the track, but on Sunday she fell ill and didn't make it to the start. Of the previous SloEnduro winners, Teja Cerar (Golovec Trails, winner in Grožnjan two years ago) and Gorana Težak (BK Buzet, winner of Trnduro 2018 ) were at the start, but it was clear that we could also get a new winner in the series.However, the experienced Istranian Gorana Težak fared the best. She won the first and the third stage, and therefore also the longest Spar Online SuperStage, and even though she lost the second stage to junior Maša Komel (KK Črn trn) by almost 5 seconds, she was leading into the last stage by 17 seconds. However, it was in the last stage that her derailleur failed, she had to run alongside the bike too, and all her advantage vanished. To be more precise: she lost all her advantage plus 24 hundredths of a second, and the young Nova Gorica rider Maša Komel, wearing the Ajdovščina club jersey, was able to enjoy her first victory in the series in her first season, after one third place and two second places (plus silver at the national championships). Third-placed Teja Cerar was not far behind, after winning the last stage she finished less than 4 seconds behind Maša.The title went more than deservedly to Tina Smrdel, winner of four races, while Maša Komel came in second ahead of Maja Vojska (MBK Črni Vrh).ResultsMen1st.

This year, he's back on the start list more fired up than ever to get back to the desert. But Alex’s return to Utah isn’t just about redemption. In Rocky Mountain’s new series “Love the Ride,” we step inside the life of Alex, a rider who lives and trains off-grid in a remote town in British Columbia. His local gym is in a former church (complete with stained glass windows), he commutes to town via boat and his on–the–bike training is on his own collection of trails and jumps shared with his neighbour and fellow Freerider Kurt Sorge. There are so many ways to get to the top, but this is how Alex is doing it.The simplicity is what gets me. Everything to do with the house is broken down in a more simple way. It's a lot more ""daily tasks"" but quite rewarding in the end. [The routine is] stretch, gym, ride, some sort of house chore to prepare for the winter, ride again, then maybe sauna. Something along those lines. The local riding community here is so strong and healthy, and has been for a long long time.

Introducing the all-new Kids’ Mythique, a full suspension mountain bike designed to be just as capable and confidence-inspiring as its adult-sized namesake, the award-winning Mythique.Coming in either 24-inch or 26-inch wheel options, the Kids’ Mythique can be sized to fit a broad range of young shredders. The 24-inch bike comes with a 120mm Manitou Junit Expert air fork and 120mm X-Fusion O2 Pro R air shock, while the 26-inch bike comes with a 130mm SR Suntour Radon34 fork and 120mm X-Fusion O2 Pro R air shock. We essentially started with the alloy frame of the adult-size Mythique and shrunk it down to be suitable for a smaller human, meaning your budding shredder can expect the same poise, playfulness, and durability that’s made the Mythique one of the most popular bikes in our lineup. It's also built using many of the same features — it’s got routing for a dropper post, uses a universal derailleur hanger, has Boost rear hub spacing, and sports proper-sized thru-axles, among other things. Like its adult-sized sibling, we’ve paid close attention to the component package and the design of the bike, striking a sweet spot that balances performance, durability, and cost. A step up from the average kids’ bike; the Kids’ Mythique is built to blitz trail, push boundaries, and foster progression in the next generation of mountain bikers. Price: $1,499 USD.

112,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/photo-epic-and-race-report-trans-new-england-2023-days-34-vermont.html,Photo Story: Trans New England 2023 Vermont Days 3 & 4 - Pinkbike,"Another race report from Trans New England, this time in Vermont."," Photo EpicTRANS NEW ENGLAND ENDURO Days 3 & 4 Vermont, USAPhotography by Josh Lawless, Vinnie Moro, Brett Protasiewicz, Jake Witlock, Scott TribbyWords by Dillon OslegerThe folded hills of Vermont allow for a diverse array of trails solely through geologic consent, and as with any form of prospecting, the deeper one searches, the more one finds. Trans New England Days 3 and 4 were spent in the Northern corner of the state, between Lake Champlain and the Connecticut River, both relics of geologic processes over 400 million years prior, allowing for an experience of the full breadth of Vermont’s terrain. The morning of day three of the five-day Enduro was spent at Cochran’s Ski Area, a small family ski hill founded in 1961, which has fostered a family of alpine racers dominant in the U.S. ski scene through the 1970s, 2000s, and 2010s. The geology on this hill provides terrain not only perfectly suited for familial on-piste training, but the decomposition of the 480 million-year-old schist rock also forms into clay and loam soils conducive to growing sugar maples and digging out trails. This environment was expressed in spades, as the morning's two stages of traversing trail wound underneath sap lines set up to harvest and process the forest's syrup come Spring. Racing was true to the spirit of enduro, complete with straight ridge line speed sections, mid-stage uphill sprints, and technical cornering. Not to let riders fall complacent to smoother tracks, the afternoon's stages were held across the valley at Bolton Resort, whereupon longer, 7+ minute stages of rocky, jank trail descended down 500 million-year-old slabs of gneiss amidst forests of Balsam Fir. End-of-day lower stages at the resort found flow between blazing autumn colors, finishing amongst a classic rally car meetup by the base lodge. As with any TNE, evening bonus stages make a mandatory appearance. The mid-week feats of strength challenge split the race into two teams, forcing a relay of shooting a hanging beer can with an air rifle, racing via potato sack, and finessing a child-size coaster brake mini bike through a pump track. Now at the falling edge of the weeks worth of racing, riders were sent to a mountaintop near Stowe, Vermont for Day 4. To quell the usual comment storm of “I could do this event by myself for so much less”, organizers set up riders with a treat of brand new trails on private property, inaccessible to the general public. Insofar as this article cannot go into the details of these trails so as to keep land managers happy, readers can rest assured that the 8 stages across 5000 vertical feet of riding were some of the best trails riders had ever experienced. Steep loamy chutes, countless granite slab rock rolls, fresh cut root sections, and high-speed off-camber slopes waiting to be burned in by fresh tire lugs, what more can any mountain biker ask for. Local burritos were delivered up the dirt road to the fern-covered meadow where racers were staged, providing an exclamation point to the uniqueness that can only be afforded by building community and paying it back, something that TNE organizers have done in spades across New England.  Midway through stages, even the most obvious of signs can be missed by racers in the zoneBy this point in the week, everyone has made lifelong friendspushing berms under tired arms and fall foliageFortunately there is ample motivation to keep pedalingTraction, always in high demandlimbering up for a 5000 foot dayFoggy mountains and perfect roads make for dreamy transfers above StoweWith a summit view to make it all worth itAnd tucked into the trees below, what trail dreams are made of...Just as long as you stay rubber side downName a better place to end a day with friendsIt's this time of year that provides a full cup of autumnBy now, hopefully it's clear that every stage is unique, made possible only by the minds of TNE organizersChipping out and heading straight for a brew to end the dayEveryone was sad to say goodbye to Vermont, but thankfully the colors and tracks were only slated to become more vibrant in MaineBlind racing, always keeping things spicy....If not with drops, then with roots,but always with sections of flow to provide a few deep breaths between jankOn site mechanics from Sram & Shimano held things down all week, making sure everyone could focus on good times instead of broken bikessTrans New England wouldn't happen without a list of stellar sponsors and partners, all of whom support the event as part of their missions of fostering mountain bike culture.

Season 1.0 was over, and season 2.0 started in a month, with Scotland's World Champs kicking off another long stint in Europe. I was spending my downtime in Truckee, California, partly for altitude training, but mostly to see my girlfriend Anna. We had signed up for Downieville the second registration opened back in the spring, and even though Anna was dealing with a knee injury and I was in the middle of a mini rest, we were still fired up about it. My dad had told me about the Downieville Classic when I was probably 15, and I remember him saying whoever won it was considered one of the best MTB all-rounders in the country. So when I first road Downieville a couple of years later, it already had a certain status in my mind. I flatted and walked 10 miles out that day, but the first part of the descent and views from the top of the Sierra Buttes made it worth it. Many people were glad to see the race return after a few-year hiatus due to COVID and wildfires, and the pro-field turnout reflected that excitement. It was as competitive as many of the top races in the U.S this year, so it felt strange to ride the XC at a chill pace for fun, instead of racing it. I had planned to only race the downhill on Sunday, but needing to finish the XC to do so, I lined up in baggies on Saturday to ride with friends I was tempted to abandon that plan on the first climb and instead follow Keegan and the leaders, but knew the rest would pay off long term. I did get to see Anna a few times during the race, in an epic battle for 3rd in the women's field. She spent the whole race leapfrogging with two other ladies, which came down to a few seconds in the end. After the race, we did the customary river swim in the 100-degree weather, lassoed some lizards, got ice cream, and camped out with the Four Wheel Camper crew. Sunday morning, we loaded six bikes in the truck camper to shuttle to the top of the downhill. This downhill epitomizes what ""downcountry"" is. There's a lot of pedaling on the course, but there's also a ton of high-speed rough sections. Most of the pros were on 120 travel bikes with beefy tires and wearing skinsuits, which is a funny combo. I was on my Epic Evo with Ground Control tires and an extra token in the fork, but forgot the skinsuit. I ended up bottoming out the travel a handful of times, but the bike was a perfect setup, and I ended up winning the TT and setting a new course record at 43:24. In the women's race, Anna came in 2nd, behind Katerina Nash, the most winningest legend of Downieville. All in all, this was the kind of weekend I needed between blocks of World Cup trips. Camping out with friends and being in the midst of the community at one of the most iconic, purebred, MTB races in the U.S. was a good refresher. I'll be back the next chance I get to go for the all-mountain title, but mostly for the trails, ice cream, and river jumps.—Christopher Blevins 

","Captures vibe of DVC really well: even if you don't get a start spot, Downieville vibe can still be had w/ way less pain for rest of shuttle season. Gotta love how a set of Ground Controls count as ""beefy"" tires for WC XC pro hunting the DH course record. Normal mortals sandbagging XC race on Day 1 would have hauled at least a Butcher/Minion to the top of the Trail of Tears for front grip on Day 2!"

As the rest of the industry has started to catch up with those shifts in approach, and with five seasons on the past bike, the team at Mondraker figured it was time for an update. Lines have been refined, standards have been updated, and they've pushed the geometry even further to match an increase in travel. With better tire clearance and room for long travel dropper posts, things are looking quite modern.F-Podium Details• Carbon frame• 29"" wheels• 110mm suspension• 120mm fork  • 66.5° head angle• 76° seat angle• 430-505mm reach• 435mm chainstays• $6,299-$13,999 USD• mondraker.comGeometryMondraker had a pretty solid footing to step from when it came time to design the new F-Podium, given how progressive the prior model was when it was released. Reach numbers have only increased by a few millimeters in each size, with the Small actually getting a bit shorter. Stack heights have gotten much taller, thanks to both an increase in the frame's height and the 10mm increase in fork travel.The head tube angle has gotten nearly a degree slacker with the updated model, and the seat tube angle is slightly steeper. The resulting 65.5° HTA and 76° STA are definitely still on the radical end of things, but don't feel too extreme given the nature of modern World Cup courses. Chainstay lengths are consistently 435mm across the board, which is only a 3mm increase over the previous model. I'm curious if we'll start seeing size-specific chainstay lengths on cross-country bikes, given the clear benefits to the more gravity-oriented side of the market. Overall, the geometry and component spec seem very well sorted, positioning the F-Podium as a capable and competitive bike on the world circuit. The bike appears to be performing well, with Ondřej Cink riding it to his current P18 in the World Cup overall.Build KitsThere are four build kits available, all featuring Mavic wheels, SRAM brakes and drivetrains, Maxxis tires, and a 50/50 split of RockShox and Fox suspension.

Here is everything you need to know ahead of the 2023 DH World Cup's conclusion at Mont-Sainte-Anne.Race BriefingComing hot off the last round in Snowshoe we finally return to Mont-Sainte-Anne for what will be a truly amazing conclusion to the 2023 series. The last time we visited it was Finn Iles and Vali Höll who topped the standings as the venue returned after a three-year break. The longest standings World Cup location always brings great racing and with two overall titles still on the line we could be in for some wild runs.After a season full of unpredictable results including seven elite male winners in seven races it doesn't look like MSA would prove any different as only a handful of riders have claimed multiple wins here. Since 2012 only Aaron Gwin and Loic Bruni have managed to repeat a win on one of downhill's longest and most gruelling courses. Loic Bruni is the only multiple MSA winner on course this week. For the women only Tahnee Seagrave and Vali Höll are previous winners who will be racing in the final round.As we look at the overall standings the Junior Men and Elite Women's title fight is all wrapped up. Both Ryan Pinkerton and Vali Höll built point leads impossible to close after Snowshoe leaving them to have zero worries when racing this weekend. In the Junior Women's standings, it's a three-way fight between Valentina Roa Sanchez, Lisa Bouladou and Erice Van Leuven, although it would take a disaster for Erice to overtake both Valentina and Lisa. Even after his finals crash last week in Snowshoe Loic Bruni still heads up the Elite Men's overall with a 60-point margin against 2nd-placed Loris Vergier. We have an article detailing who can win the overall coming later this week but for now, we believe there is a possible 250 points on offer for the finale allowing anyone currently in the top four to take the title this weekend. The current top four are Loic Bruni, Loris Vergier, Jackson Goldstone and Finn Iles.We hope that helps get you prepped for this weekend's racing and keep scrolling to gather more details to get you ready for the final round of DH racing in MSA.What happened at the Last Round?Snowshoe never fails to deliver drama as the rough, wild and greasy course brought amazing moments throughout the week with an incredible day of elite racing on Saturday showing just how great downhill racing can be when the world's best are pushing the limits. Erice Van Leuven backed up a dominant qualifying performance putting together an impeccable finals run to lead the Junior Women by almost six seconds. The World Champ was back on top in Snowshoe as she bested Transition Factory Racing's Taylor Ostgaard and Valentina Roa Sanchez.It was four wins in a row for Ryan Pinkerton as he not only took a victory on home soil but he also wrapped up the 2023 overall series title. Evan Medcalf ran a close race to Ryan, ending the day 0.327 seconds back in 2nd. Mylann Falquet completed the top three Junior Men, 1.964 seconds off Ryan's pace.Marine Cabirou secured back-to-back World Cup wins as she pulled ahead of overall standings rival Nina Hoffmann by 0.344 seconds. Vali Höll kept things calm and controlled to go over the line in third place and secure the 2023 overall series champion title. While the series winner has been decided we still have a close fight for second place as Marine Cabirou carries the momentum of two wins into a final showdown with Nina Hoffmann.Elite men's racing doesn't get much better than this as Oisin O Callaghan secures a wild first elite win by 0.496 seconds producing an incredible moment as the cameras caught his moment of disbelief when he realised he was the winner.

In the Junior Men's racing, Jackson Goldstone secured the win on home soil. Jordan Williams crossed the line just under four seconds back with Bodhi Kuhn completing the top three. Phoebe Gale took the win in the Junior Women's race with a dominant run and a gap of almost seven seconds to Izabela Yankova. Gracey Hemstreet ended the weekend in third.Vali Höll took another win in 2022 as she pulled over three seconds ahead of a hard-charging Nina Hoffmann. Eleonora Farina was the only other rider to beat the fastest qualifying run and crossed the line in third. Myriam Nicole was leading even against Vali by over two seconds after split two but a flat tire took away her chance of a win.Finn Iles pushed past unbelievable pressure to take his first World Cup win in Canada. Finn became the first Canadian to win at home since Stevie Smith in 2013 and he didn't have a chain at the end of his run.

117,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/first-look-orange-patriot-epo.html,First Look: Orange Patriot E.P.O - Pinkbike,"Before there were e-bikes, there was freeride."," It's becoming a thing for bike brands to dust off old model names and apply them to e-bikes. The original Orange Patriot was a classic freeride bike of the early two-thousands. The new Patriot E.P.O (Electric Powered Orange) bears about as much relationship to the original as Mel Gibson's movie does to history. It has more in common with Orange's Switch 7 enduro bike, with 170 mm of travel at each end and mullet wheels, mated to a Bosch Performance Line CX motor with a 750 Wh battery.While the motor may be relatively new to Orange, they're still made in-house in the UK out of folded sheets of aluminium, as they have been since around the time of the Magna Carta.Patriot Details• 170 mm travel front & rear• Mullet wheels• Bosch Performance Line CX motor, 750 Wh battery• Sizes: S-XL• Linkage-driven suspension• Price: £8800 | €9500 | $9900 USD• www.orangebikes.comSuspensionLike the Switch 7 and Stage 7, it uses Orange's latest innovation: a link to drive the shock in a way that offers some progression to help with bottom-out resistance. The Strange Powerlink system results in a 25% drop in leverage ratio from 0% to 100% travel, making it progressively harder to compress the shock towards bottom-out as the leverage ratio decreases. In contrast, Orange's single-pivot bikes for which they're best known have a leverage ratio that remains approximately constant throughout the travel, meaning bottom-out resistance is left up to the shock. GeometryThe geometry is designed for stability, with a slack 63-degree head angle and relatively long 448 mm chainstays. The geometry is very similar to the Switch 7 enduro bike, but with a 5 mm higher bottom bracket (and 5 mm shorter crank) to help reduce pedal strikes.Price and partsFor now, there's just one build: the Patriot LE. It goes for £8800 | €9500 | $9900 USD. For that, you get Fox Performance-level suspension (Grip fork damper), Shimano SLX drivetrain (with SRAM NX chain); SRAM Guide RE brakes and Stan's Flow/Hope Pro5 wheels.

DBN stands for Double Barrel Nut, a reference to the rotating components, that allow the clamp to actuate.Having launched in 2022, the DBN has become one of our most popular products, continuing the quest to make mountain bike products better in every way and today we are announcing an additional 6 sizes to accommodate nearly all the varying sizes across the market.Concept: We designed this to offers exceptional and consistent clamping force, ensuring that your seat post remains securely in place, without crushing your dropper post. The Barrel Nuts rotate during clamping, keeping the custom designed bolt perfectly straight; reducing the stress in this area.Compatibility: The DBN Seat Post Clamp now comes in 10 sizes ranging from 28.6 through to 39.7 and we believe that Pembree has the most choice of any company globally. The size is machined directly onto the clamp body to avoid any mis-sizing situations.Environment:• The DBN is manufactured in PEMBREE’s own factory that is powered entirely on renewable energy. • The clamp body is machined out of UK-produced 75% recycled aluminium which minimises the carbon footprint • The DBN can be 100% recycled at the end of its life. Precision Engineering: the DBN is machined on a Brother 5 axis Mill/ Turn CNC machine and is loaded via an ABB robot. The final bore is turned rather than milled resulting in an incredibly accurate clamp that will fit frames perfectly.Customisation: Available in all 8 PEMBREE colours to match any bike.The response to the DBN has been overwhelming, our customers globally appreciate the thought and care that we have taken with the clamp, the attention to detail at every level…including the box! By increasing the number of sizes to 10 means we are producing 80 variations which realistically is only possible when you manufacture the products in house. Our commitment to minimising our carbon footprint continues as always and the DBN looks sweet!”—Phil Law, Pembree FounderAs with everything PEMBREE it’s perfect, not over engineered, the attention to detail , even on a seat clamp, is outstanding, British engineering at its best.""—Rob Warner, MTB LegendThe DBN is a no brainer. It's simple, looks great, is available in lots of colours and sizes, and does the job better than just about anything else.

Oisin topped the podium in West Virginia as he became the first Irishman to win an elite men's World Cup and was closely followed by Ronan Dunne for a historic Ireland one-two. We caught up with the young racer following his win to hear his thoughts on his first big win as the seventh winner of a World Cup in seven rounds this season.At only 20 years of age, Oisin O'Callaghan becomes the first Irish World Cup winner, adding to his achievements as a previous Junior World Champion. Rollback to 2019, and you'll find the day Oisin was scouted by the YT MOB World Tour. Since then, he has been putting in the work, with h is dedication being on full display this past weekend in Snowshoe. We're stoked to see Oisin get back on that top step!—YT How does it feel to take your first Elite World Cup win?To take my first Elite win is something I’ve dreamed of for a while. This weekend it all pieced together, and what a weekend it was. I’m still speechless. What went through your head as you crossed the finish line and saw you were in the lead?When I went into the lead, I was already incredibly stoked knowing I had secured my first Elite podium. Then, I realized there was only one man left (Loic Bruni). I was on the edge of my seat, seeing how tight the splits were! How tough was it to watch the final riders come down, especially Loic, who pulled ahead of you in split three before his crash?It was going to be close. Everyone was watching so closely, and when Loic went down, it was almost a moment of disbelief. I was truly shocked (I think you saw that on my face, haha)! It would have been cool to see what would have happened if he made it to the end, but that’s racing, and this week we go again! You were having great results across the week in Snowshoe, what clicked for you at this round?After getting sick in Les Gets, I went home and reset. I got some good chill time, and coming into this one, I felt refreshed and ready to go again, which seems to work for me. If I’m relaxed and having fun, I’m doing good.It’s so good to be flying the Irish flag high and showing the young rippers at home that dreams really do come true! The course was pretty brutal in Snowshoe, how did you manage to stay fast all week while avoiding any big crashes?A lot of people had big crashes this week, and there were a lot of injuries–healing vibes to those! Thankfully, I stayed clear of most of it, having one small crash in practice, but once I got that out of the way, I was happy. Always good to get the first one out of the way. Your last World Cup win was as a Junior back in 2020. How does it feel to be back on top of the podium in only your 2nd elite season?I feel like it’s been a while since I was on the podium in my Junior years. It felt damn good to get back on the podium (and win), and it reminded me of what’s possible.  Not only did you take the win last weekend, but you got to share the moment with Ronan Dunne. How was it to have the first Ireland one-two at a World Cup?Absolutely crazy! Ireland 1-2 is just mental. We train together, ride together, and party together–It’s so good to be flying the Irish flag high and showing the young rippers at home that dreams really do come true!It would be sick to finish the year with a ‘mudder’. Full waterproofs and roll-offs. These were Ireland's best-ever results for Elite Mens World Cup racing. Does that make the win just that bit more special to you?Yes, it feels a bit surreal being the first Irish man to win a World Cup, but I’m proud to have done it! I was the first to win a junior World Cup and World Champs for Ireland as well, so to continue in my Elite career and make history again feels great! With the weather looking unpredictable for the final round this week, how are you feeling ahead of MSA?Being from Ireland, I love a good wet race. We haven’t really had a proper wet race all year, so let’s see what this weekend brings. It would be sick to finish the year with a ‘mudder’. Full waterproofs and roll-offs, I’m keen as! After your win in Snowshoe, have your expectations gone up for the final round this week?I always want to do my best. Obviously, everyone loves to win, but there are currently 20-odd people fighting for that title every week, which is amazing. I’m hoping for another solid result this weekend to end the season. It’s my first time racing in MSA, so I’m going to have to learn the track, but I’ll be swinging off it no matter what. Is there anything else you would like to add?Shoutout to everyone for the support! The YT MOB, the home crowd, it’s been unreal.

As always Snowshoe provided no shortage of drama, exhilarating racing and moments we won't be forgetting for a long while. As the teams make the road trip to the classic venue of Mont-Sainte-Anne here's an update on how the PB Racing team faired in West Virginia.Race RecapThe week kicked off with the course in Snowshoe covered in fog with plenty of moisture to make the always greasy track just a little bit spicier for the initial laps. While most of the course would dry out by finals the roots and rocks remained constant threats for a run or even a race-ending incident as levels of grip varied massively across the 1.9km course. Torin's first reaction to the seventh round's course was: ""This track is gnarly but scary in wet conditions"". While Thibault Laly with past experience of just how wild the racing can get in Snowshoe was more like: ""Oh sh*t, not again! I want some dry rocks please.""Aimi Kenyon saw a return to form and found her speed in Snowshoe as she made it into the top five in qualifying 15 seconds back from the leader but only 0.854 off second place, a great first result of the week. Aimi had a tricky run in finals that ended up being a little messy but still good enough for seventh place. A great last split saw Aimi only lose 0.7 seconds to the charging race winner Erice Van Leuven and will be a great confidence boost heading into Mont-Sainte-Anne. We have our fingers crossed for a podium in MSA.It was amazing to see Ben back between the poles this week after breaking his back at the first round in Lenzerheide. While Ben may have just missed out on making it to the semi-finals by just under two seconds finishing in 65th the speed is coming back and we think this week in MSA will be the one. Either way Ben will be providing more expert analysis and recaps of the racing.Wyatt Harrington struggled to find the pace over the slippery rocks and sadly had a mechanical during qualifying pushing him down to 43rd. Through the first two splits, Wyatt was able to be the 23rd and 25th fastest times showing he was right on pace to qualify before his mechanical. This week is a race on home soil for Wyatt so he will be pushing extra hard for a good result, hopefully, he will have a bit more luck.Finally, Thibault Laly was feeling good on track in Snowshoe through the week and was still able to qualify for semis with a mechanical in 47th place. When the time came for the semi-finals Thibault set an amazing top split in 19th before becoming one of many riders ending their week after colliding with a tree. We are hoping Thibault is doing okay but he says he has a very sore shoulder and is not sure if he will be racing in MSA. Currently, it has not been X-rayed so we are unsure if there is anything broken.Just like that the penultimate round of the series is over and the team now makes the trip to the legendary Mont-Sainte-Anne for what could be another washout with rain expected to make things extra chaotic for the final showdown of the 2023 World Cup series.Story of the Race with Ben CathroBen Cathro wraps up the spectacular Snowshoe racing as the fastest riders in the world take on one of the most technical tracks in the UCI Mountain Bike World Series. 

","Maybe someone could point me to an article in case I've missed it, but what I really want to know is team feedback on the Dorado they are running this year compared to the Ohlins last year.
Of course it will be biased by sponsorship, but this seems like a big change and I'd love to hear how it went."

RD #8 We Are One Canadian Enduro League Presented By Leatt, and the Three Peaks Classic is a brand new three day festival, you won’t want to miss this next year!The weekend had it all, the unveiling of a new loamer, group rides, an Air DH, Slalom, Uphill Climb Challenge (scroll to see the debauchery), and of course a really insane Enduro! RD #8 Canadian Enduro League Race Recap  Sun Peaks is undoubtedly one of BC's best bike parks. The resort features a huge array of trails from machine-built flow, tight tech, and handbuilt singletrack. There's something for everything! It was an easy decision to end our BC season here, and throw in a bit of a festival vibe for good measure and to make it a family affair. With over 300 riders entered, this was the largest event of the year.Sunday's Enduro was certainly the feature race. Riders faced 6 race stages covering just over 46km, with 3000m of climbing, of course, the lift was used, and what a treat as practice was straight up sloppy. The perk of the rain on practice day led to hero conditions on Sunday unless you were first down in the early hours of the morning as a frost had set up on some of the more shaded areas. The stoke started to build at the finish line as times rolled in. There was some absolutely incredible racing. In the U21 Women's field, Pella Ward had a consistent day, taking the top step on all but one stage to claim the win by a massive 1 minute. Hannah Gillcrist and Madelyn Bonikowsky went back and forth all day long in the fight for second, but when it was all said and done, Hannah took the advantage and took the second step, with Madelyn in third. On the U21 Men's side, despite a bit of a slow start to the day, Zachary Rebitt put down a dominating performance to claim the win by almost a minute.For the Pro Women, it was anyone's guess throughout the day who was going to take the top step. In the end, we were stoked to see Chloe McKenzie claim her second Canadian Enduro League win, with Marie Corriveau in second and CEL Rider Rep Tori Wood in third. On the Men's side, the Sun Peaks podium was a who's who of Canadian Enduro World Cup racers, with We Are One rider Jonathan Helly taking the top step ahead of Elliot Jamieson in second and Evan Wall in third.Want to skip straight to the results? We got you! Click Here                                We Are One Arrival Giveaway This season, we have been incredibly lucky to have the generous support of We Are One Composites. Not only did their support help to provide racers with the lowest registration fees since 2019, but they also gave us a brand new We Are One Arrival to giveaway. After dragging out the anticipation for as long as we could, We Are One Pro rider Jonathan Helly did the honors of drawing a name. The tension was immense but Liam Trewhitt was the lucky winner. What a way to end a race weekend. In a crazy turn of events, Liam broke his frame during the weekend and actually borrowed one of We Are One's Arrival demo bikes to complete the race. We're stoked for your Liam, enjoy it!   Three Peaks Classic This weekend was not just about the enduro though. The Three Peaks Classic brought together a group ride, Slalom, Air DH, a Hill Climb Challenge, and the Canadian Enduro League together to create one epic weekend of racing bikes.Things kicked off on Friday with the Slalom. Anyone that knows us, knows that we love a good slalom race, and this weekend was no different. The turns had been laid out, and right from the get go the grass was ready to fight back. 40 odd racers dropped their tire pressure to single digits and risked life and limb to put down a time.                        Saturday's Air Downhill event was a somewhat soggy affair. After a season of sunshine, we were bound to get some rain, and we got it! A whole season's worth in one afternoon. Add in a little thunder, lightning, and a good dump of hail, and it was a tough day. A huge thank you to all the riders for being so understanding and a massive massive thank you to all the volunteers that helped with this event. You are all legends!      The final event of the weekend   StumpWheed  This weekend's Enduro race course featured a very special trail. Stage 4, ""Stumpwheed"" was specifically built for the race and opened just days prior - it's fresh to say the least. It was a special project for us, led by the Sun Peaks Recreational Trails Association and supported by the Canadian Enduro League, McElhanney, We Are One Composites, and local trail builders.When SPRTA approached us about joining forces to build an epic new trail, specifically for the Sun Peaks round of the Canadian Enduro League, we simply couldn't say no! Stumpwheed is a Black-rated trail that winds its way down Mt Morrisey. It features some of the province's best berms, more loam than you dream of, and an unbeatable raw flow.A huge thank you to the main builders, Jordan Proctor and Dylan Sheffer, who spent many, many hours over the summer battling stumps, weeds, and buck brush in the Morrisey forest. Thank you as well to Jacob Tooke and Alex Silverthorne, who also pitched in plenty of build time. Credit for the trail design/layout goes to that crew, along with Mike Sleziak, Ted Morton, Sam Loxton, and the McElhanney team.      Trail Love This weekend was a special one for the riders. With the opening of the Stumpwheed trail, and the tip top trail conditions, we cannot thank the Sun Peaks Recreational Trails Association enough for the support. We're incredibly grateful for their support, and enthusiasm in running events. We know that these events are tough on trails! We were absolutely thrilled to be able to give back $3000 to the Sun Peaks Recreational Trails Association this weekend.Want to support the trails yourself? Head over to the SPRTA website and grab yourself a membership! Thank You A huge thank you has to go out to the following people: Sun Peaks Resort, Sun Peaks Recreational Trails Association, Tourism Sun Peaks, Trailbuilders Dylan Sheffer, Jordan Proctor, Alex Silverthorn, the We Are One Crew, Jacob Tooke and Ted Morton and everyone else that came out and moved dirt, our volunteers and absolutely everyone else in making this weekend amazing.

An A-frame lodge facing out onto wildflower-strewn sled hills, broken up by dark shadows cast from densely packed firs, beech, and white pine where the slope steepens drastically. Day two of Trans New England took place in Claremont, New Hampshire, home to Arrowhead Ski Hill, just one of many such ski hills in the ""Live Free or Die"" state. Across a six hour, 4000 vertical foot day, 8 stages slowly atrophied legs and worn out arms from a cyclical repetition of steep transfers and jank descents. Along these stages, an equal measure of history was traversed, including 60 million years of geology within repeating rock slab drops, etches on said rocks from British loyalists during the founding moments of the US in 1764, and loam pockets trodden by the Abenaki people as far back as 1300 CE. It was in between these tracks that riders became comfortable enough with one another to forge lifelong friendships over beers, crashes, local barbecue, and stellar stages of racing. Local trail builders, bike shop owners, nonprofit executives, and city officials dropped by to show support for the opportunity that mountain biking affords their small communities. Racers from neighboring states, across the nation, and from destinations abroad shared a mutual appreciation for the world class nature of the trails amidst such a welcoming community, that none ever expected to exist on a small 400 vertical foot ski hill. As if a perfect day couldn't be improved upon, a transfer to Bolton Valley, Vermont that evening meant a mandatory stop at the local dairy for Creemees - a variant on soft serve ice cream endemic to the ""Freedom & Unity"" state. By the end of day 2, the race lead is on the shoulders of two Canadian residents: Felix Burke and Jo Grace Peters, but the ethos' of Live Free, Freedom and Unity all strike true as characteristic of both place and event.Stay tuned for updates from Vermont & Maine in the coming days!

(If you'd like to catch up on the injury updates so far, you can find my first four-month check-in here, then one from six months later here, and a podcast chat here. The main idea, for context, is that I crashed and hit my head a year ago, sustaining a traumatic brain injury that put me in a nine-day ""state of impending death"" and a coma, kept me in hospitals for over two months and in intensive outpatient treatments for another two, and generally - although it's played out about as well as possible - been a pretty huge bummer.)To preface all of this, I'm a little self-conscious about putting an article about recent adventures out there because I'm nervous about people repeating something I've heard in real life along the lines of ""Wow, you're clearly doing everything you want to do - seems like that injury was a positive for you!"" Just... no. This has been a big enough life event that there's a whole range of emotions related to it, and it feels impossible to reduce it to just any one feel, but if I were going to try to do that, it wouldn't look very positive. Still, there's been elation, real learning, connection, and so much love all around. It's cool that I get to often choose in the moment which of the many sides to focus on.The last time I wrote, I'd just recently gotten into mountain biking again, and it felt like good practice for me. Still, one of the central parts of my experience with biking, that I mostly tried to ignore, was that it just wasn't fun. It was actually the opposite, quite unpleasant thanks to my balance having become unpredictable yet predictably bad, my visual processing too slow for me to feel like I understood much of the terrain coming at me, my ability to see while transitioning between sunlight and shadows disappearing... basically, despite having some rad friends go on rides with me and being so thankful I still can do this sport, it's just been not a very good time, and an even less good time when considering how sad it felt to lose something that I've more or less centered my life on for the last decade. Anyway, more on my evolving feelings about mountain biking later.Soon after I last wrote, I got hand surgery, which really killed my momentum around biking when my hand was casted for a while, there was a pin in my finger, and all of that. I went to Crankworx right after that, and spent a week having the weird experience of being at Whistler specifically to enjoy and support the sport of mountain biking but without even pedaling a bike the whole time. I wrote a few articles from Crankworx and recorded a bit of podcast talk, but mainly was there to spend time with the Pinkbike crew. Mission accomplished.The following weekend, I went to this year's edition of Hangtime, the women's freeride event where I was injured last year. I am a big fan of the event and am so glad I had the chance to go this year, but also, wow. That was an experience.The event happens in Bellingham, WA, where I live, and is run by Hannah Bergemann, queen of the Blue Steel jump line, where it happens. The basic idea is that a bunch of female riders are invited to come throw down on the jumps for two days with morning and evening sessions and a spectator showdown the second evening. It's not a competition but is more a community hype event, where the riders can have a supportive environment for feeding off each other and chasing their riding goals. Last year, I crashed and hit my head on the first evening.For the first day and a half of this year's two-day event, I was almost a little disappointed that I didn't feel much. Like, I was happy for the ladies riding and felt kind of neutrally positive about the whole thing happening, but it stopped there. Where's the processing of seeing the place and the setting where my life forever changed? I'd felt more even during a running race on Galbraith a while back that routed us somewhat near the jumps, but not even within sight.Anyway, the collapse I didn't even know I was avoiding happened on the final evening, when I crumbled into one of the bigger meltdowns of my life - just seeing the whole scene, I think a scene I was really looking forward to being part of last year. I'm so glad I got to go and am really thankful for how it played out, how caring and kind and supportive the riders all were toward each other and toward me.Then, I spent a bit of time in Missoula, Montana, where I used to live. The report I have from there is from a bike-hike-fly-raft day. I rode my bike from where I was housesitting to a trailhead, hiked up to the top of Mt. Sentinel, launched my paraglider and flew to near East Missoula, landed near the river, packed up, inflated my packraft that I'd carried in my paragliding harness, rafted back down the river to near my bike, and biked back to where I was staying.The day was great. The bike ride part was a nice flat ten minutes on my commuter, the hike was up a steep, rocky ridge trail that I used to really like to night ride down, though my pack was heavy enough with my paraglider and raft that the hike up was a definite challenge, the flight was really nothing impressive but got me close to a popular river put-in, so that float back was respectable and really enjoyable. I think it all went really well - I figured out, too, that my paraglider fits into a zipped internal storage compartment in the body of my raft, a great spot to save space and keep the wing dry. The rest of my flying gear went into a large plastic bag, which fit nicely in front of me. My main goal with this fly-raft thing is to figure out bigger cross-country flights and raft trips back, so in some ways I thought of that Missoula day as a test run, but it went well enough that I don't think there's much troubleshooting to do right now. I'm really happy with it and excited to do more with that idea in the future.The next highlight was in Utah, where I went to fly at a site I've flown for four years now each fall. My first time to that zone, two of us had launched from one mountain, climbed a few thousand feet on rising air and crossed to a neighboring mountain, landed and camped on a small ridge, and relaunched and flown back down to town the next morning. That adventure has taken up a lot of space in my mind since, having shown me that I could just think of something to do and then, just, do it. Nothing was stopping me other than the friction of taking the initiative to do the things I want to do, a limiter that's not even a real thing anyway.So this year, I decided to recreate that first mini 'vol biv' or fly-camp mission, this time solo and with a little more experience in the sport. I crossed from the same launch to the same nearby mountain, was able to soar higher on it this time, and eventually landed on a sidehill that seemed launchable the next morning. (The above photo, the one near the tent that I described as the happiest photo of me ever, is from where I landed.) The next morning, unfortunately, I didn't get weather conditions I felt comfortable launching from that spot in, so I spent that day taking a long walk out. That said, it was maybe more perfect that I didn't get to wrap up that adventure in a neat, tidy way with a bow on it. Since the trip didn't go perfectly to plan, I have more fire than ever to keep developing my vol biv abilities and make some successful trips happen. And the trip went well enough that I'm still over the moon about it.The rest of my Utah paragliding trip actually kind of continued in that vein. I did a weeklong cross-country paragliding competition, the type of competition where my scores will be mediocre at best but I'll have the priceless opportunity to fly with and watch and learn from all my heroes, and the community I get to be part of there goes so far beyond that.That type of paragliding competition involves a series of 'task' days, on which the organizers set a course of GPS turnpoints and pilots are scored based on how quickly they fly the course or how far along they make it. The winner will be in the air for maybe an hour and a half, and most will fly for hours.The last task day, I was having a decent flying day. I'd actually never flown for more than four hours before, having landed several times around the 3:50 mark, and started getting low again around then but managed to climb back up, fighting in a series of turbulent thermals to go from 7.3k' up over 15k, which brought me a whole lot of relief until I eventually was in much deeper terrain and getting low once again, around the five-hour airtime mark. I ended up landing far from any roads. One of the biggest benefits of doing paragliding races is that 'retrieve' will pick pilots up as close as possible to where they landed, but pilots deep are out of luck. The retrieve coordinator's first InReach message to me included ""You are deeeep... You're gonna have to hike a ways."" And hike I did. Long after dark, I met up with two crew members who had hiked partway in to take my backpack and help make the getting-out process a little easier. I went to a lot of emotional and mental places during those hours of hiking out with my heavy pack, but I do think all that's good for me.One of the more interesting pieces about that hike out was how aware I was of my new balance limitations, how risk and safety have moved in the ways they affect my decision-making. I've lost so much of my balance and coordination from this injury that hiking with a heavy backpack on uneven ground has become challenging, to put it really mildly. I landed on a little high point with a hike down a steep hill then through a series of drainages to get out. I had my maximum paragliding kit, which has a heavy competition harness with two reserve parachutes, an oxygen tank for high altitudes, and basically no planning for the purpose of lightness. So my backpack was closing in on 50 lbs and the steep slope was moving when I stepped on it. Not exactly a recipe for success. I fell over more times than I want to admit and got a tiny bit of bleak amusement out of the fact that I'd checked off the blood-sweat-tears triad several times over. (I do feel the need to defend myself a little bit here and say that at no point was I at any real risk of hitting my head again.) Anyway, I eventually did make it out, and enough time has passed that I can now look back on that afternoon and evening and night fondly. I think it was a great end to the competition week.The next day I spent in the mountains was, similarly, a nice big scramble. Saturday, September 30, was a year after my crash, and I decided it would probably be a good day to go outside and disappear for a while.I woke up early, drove up a monstrously long dirt road, and started moving toward Hadley Peak. Hadley Peak is a pointy sub-peak on the north flank of Mt Baker. There's a trail leading part of the way up it, but the rest involves a little more route-finding. Six inches of new-ish plus some older snow made things a little tougher, and at several points I wasn't sure how far I'd make it, but the snow ended up being just fine.The hours moved by quickly, and somehow the Hadley Peak day felt like it gave me a lot of what I'm looking for and only sometimes find when I go into the mountains. It felt really great. I fully lost my sense of where I was in space and time. I've lost a lot of my sense of space and time after this injury anyway, but handing that awareness off in a way that I meant to sign up for felt pretty nice.I have nothing at all and everything in the world to say about that day, but I think I'll keep most of it to myself for now. I'm just glad I went. I've been getting more and more little glimpses of myself again lately, getting to have moments when just existing feels like being me, and that's a good thing.Now, enjoy some of my phone photos from yesterday, a combination of craggy rocks and dorky selfies. I know this article is getting almost unreasonably long and I know these are a lot of photos, but I like them and I figure if you've made it this far down the page already, you probably have patience for me and my whims.Sometimes when I'm out doing something, I get the almost giddy feeling of holy shit, after this entire ridiculous year, I'm still standing and I still get to go out and do this. I felt that way for a lot of the day Saturday, and it was nice.The sun came out again after the snow.The route stuck with a trail for the first three-point-something miles, but by the time the trail disappeared the ground had long been covered in snow. I followed that up a long ridge, which then becomes a steep slog up to the final ridge that includes several rocky gendarmes and eventually leads to the summit. Climbers can climb up to then cross to the other side of that final ridge, then follow that up to the peak.That was some powerful terrain. Time is a batshit insane thing, what it can do on both small and large scales. Geology is neat, lots of this is neat.I don't have any major takeaways to share here from that day, just that it was f*cking good, and a great way to spend a day that could have been immensely painful. (Actually, it still was - lots of life is these days - but that pain also got to be mixed with some really really intensely positive feelings too.)But hey, I said earlier that I'd fill you in on my relationship with biking, and now it's time to do that. See, I've started to like biking again, which is pretty cool. At the beginning of last week, I announced to my housemates that I'd go mountain biking the next day. ""Now that I've said it out loud to you, I won't be able to back out,"" I remember saying. Before last week, I hadn't biked in a little while because I was busy then very sick then surrounded by rain, and I lost enough momentum that I really didn't feel very motivated to go out on two wheels anymore. Still, I did, and something clicked that first ride back.I pedaled from home, climbed a climbing trail that I'd never heard of but was just right, not too steep but with enough roots to make it technically challenging for me, then climbed another trail I vaguely remember from back in the day, then descended a trail I really like, one that I used to tack onto the end of most of my Galbraith rides because it went in the right direction and I liked it. Turns out, now, it's perfectly at my maximum, just tricky enough to keep me fully focused, engaged in the way that keeps me from thinking about anything else, which I think is the feeling that originally drew me into mountain biking.I spent a lot of that ride grinning, kind of stunned that I still can go out and goof around on a bike, that after the intense hospital chaos that's been my last year, I still have times when I can just go into the woods and be fully present there. I love the smell of all the plants I ride past. It's just nice to be out.Then, when I got back home that first evening, I noticed I was already scheming about riding the exact same loop the next day. So I did. It rained the next morning so the roots were all slippery, maxing out my bikehandling ability, but morale stayed high enough. It was really good to be out.Sometimes looking ahead doesn't suck. Photo evidence that I've been getting out on the bike.Then, I went again a day later. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself here, but I think something has shifted, and I think I can say that I officially enjoy mountain biking again. That's a big relief for a lot of reasons. I mean, the idea of working for Pinkbike while not enjoying mountain biking sounds tough, especially when I could just... like biking. So even just for human-job alignment, it makes a lot of sense for me to be into the sport. Plus, there's the whole world of everything I've gotten from the sport, which I described in a past article as: ""The experience of working at something and seeing the progress, friendship and a venue where consistently being at our limits makes us all better at being friends with some nice forced vulnerability, permission to play around and just have fun, a job, and so much more."" So now, I'm not only going to hang onto what mountain biking has already given me, but I think it's still very possible to keep leaning into that growth.I guess that's my main big-and-not-big-at-the-same-time update, that the thing people probably assumed I still liked is back in my good graces. I'm beyond certain that things will still be hard going forward. Really, really hard. But I've done hard things before, so I can keep putting one foot in front of the other here. One of my most fundamental beliefs is that when taking 100 steps feels impossible, I'm still totally able to figure out taking one or two, then just doing that over and over and over. That's exactly how life feels right now, just continuing to do what I can to move forward. It's working well enough.So to all of you out there, whoever and however you are, thanks for reading this and thanks for being there for me. The support from the people around has been mindblowing, both from my community like family, friends, and coworkers, and from people I've never met but who have chosen to be kind. You'll probably never know just how much that's meant. So much.Signed with lots of love as always,Alicia

Through their custom paint option, Orbea has done just that, giving Pierre this yellow whip to race on for the remainder of the season. The build kit is as you'd expect at the sharp end of the modern XC field, with a good mix of lightweight yet robust components ready for heavy sprints and some fairly technical riding. Unsurprisingly, there's a lot of Orbea's own house-brand components on the bike, from the Oquo wheels to the ""OC"" components for the cockpit. Other key components are taken care of by Fox, Shimano, and Maxxis.  David Campos' Orbea AlmaDavid Campos just won the European XCC title on this bike, with one key setup difference: he was running the bike fully rigid, sporting an Orbea Spirit carbon fork instead of suspension of any sort. Seems more like a gravel bike to me, but apparently it was the tool for the track.

It's called the Megawatt Carbon, and as the name suggests, it boasts a full-carbon fiber frame alongside the new drive unit. Nukeproof will continue to make the alloy Megawatt with a Shimano motor to cater to the lower end of the market, as the new version is an unashamedly premium affair. For the full story on the SRAM powertrain motor, check out our earlier article here. But for now, suffice it to say it offers loads of power (90 Nm torque, 680 W peak power), a quiet ride and - in combination with SRAM's Transmission gearing - the option to shift gears automatically and/or while coasting. The Megawatt uses a 720 Wh battery, which is also an improvement on the Shimano-powered bike. Megawatt Carbon Details• SRAM Powertrain motor, 720 Wh battery, auto shifting• 170 mm travel front & rear• Fully carbon frame• Mullet wheels• Sizes: S-XXL• Claimed weight: 24 Kg / 53 lb• Price: £8,799/€10,499/$9,899 - £9,999/ €11,999/$10,899• Water bottle + internal storage• nukeproof.comNukeproof have also tweaked the suspension, increased the travel and adjusted the geometry while they're at it. The original Megawatt had a particularly well-balanced ride quality. We got the chance to ride the carbon version and see if it's even better.Frame & MotorNukeproof designed the frame so the battery slides out the bottom of the downtube and is held in place with a single bolt for easy battery swaps or off-bike charging. This design saves a bit of weight compared to a battery that slots into the underbelly of the downtube. They angled the motor so the battery slides out easily, and this left some room underneath the motor and behind the battery. Nukeproof made use of this by attaching bosses to the inside of the plastic cover, which can be used to carry a conventional tool mount with an inner tube, CO2, multitool etc. The plastic cover is held in place with a threaded cap that you can remove by hand like a fork's air valve cap. At the launch, one of these came loose and fell off, and another was too tight to remove without pliers, so hopefully, Nukeproof can improve on this for production. There's room for a 500 ml water bottle in all sizes and there's another accessory mount under the top tube. The mainframe has carbon channels above the battery for easy cable installation, and the chainstay and seatstay are carbon, too. The frame is protected with extensive contoured rubber armour plus a clear protection kit to preserve the paint. The suspension pivots on full complement Enduro max bearings.An integrated chain guide is apparently essential to ensure the reliability of the automatic shifting, which can shift gears while you're hammering through rock gardens. The derailleur is powered from the main battery via a power cable. This cable only provides energy; all the communication between the motor and gears is wireless. SRAM say you'll still get about two hours of shifting after the drive battery runs out. You can also use a regular AXS battery, but because Autoshift changes gear more often than a manual derailleur, it won't last as long.GeometryThe SRAM motor is a little bigger than Shimano's, so Nukeproof had to extend the chainstay length compared to the alloy Megawatt - from 442 mm to 447 mm. That number is the same for all frame sizes, but the seat tube gets slightly steeper in the larger sizes to stop tall riders from ending up too far over the rear axle. The head angle is half a degree slacker than the original Megawatt too, apparently to compensate for the longer back end. Suspension DesignStarting with the same Horst-link design used on the Mega and Megawatt alloy, Nukeproof increased the travel slightly from 165 mm to 170 mm. They also made the linkage very slightly more progressive - there's now 24% less leverage over the shock at the end of the travel than at the start, compared to 22% previously. They also gave the bike more anti-squat by making the axle path a little more rearward. That means it should stay higher in its travel when pedalling up steep climbs.Bearings at the rear shock eyelet help to minimise friction where it matters most. Both carbon models use a RockShox Vivid air shock with hydraulic bottom-out adjustment.Models, specs & pricingMegawatt Carbon Pro - £8,799/€10,499/$9,899Megawatt Carbon RS - £9,999/ €11,999/$10,899Ride ImpressionsI had a full day's ride on the Megawatt in Andalo, Italy. I won't repeat everything Mike Kazimer already said about the motor, but from my perspective I liked the ability to just ride and not think about shifting when riding casually, but when negotiating a technical climb or sudden change of gradient, you'll still want to manually override the system or even use the manual mode. It's like how an automatic car is fine for collecting shopping, but an enthusiastic driver on a tricky road will want to do it the old-fashioned way. As for the bike, it reminded me a lot of the original Megawatt, which is a good thing as it's still among the best-handling full-fat e-bikes I've ridden. With the fork and shock damping run pretty open, it's relatively responsive for its weight. Despite the longer chainstays, it's not too hard to maneuver around, hop and manual, but there's always plenty of traction on the front tire. I rode the (recommended) XL size, which fitted me nicely at 191 cm / 6'3"", providing loads of stability without feeling dead in tighter sections.Pointed down rough pinball sections, it has even more of a downhill bike quality than the original Megawatt, thanks to the extra travel, slacker head angle and Vivid air shock with its hydraulic bottom-out control. The Continental Kryptotal DH tires also help it to feel stuck to the ground. I would prefer more than 170 mm of dropper post travel, though.When climbing, the Megawatt's sticky tires, steep-ish seat tube and powerful yet smooth motor make it particularly forgiving.

128,https://www.pinkbike.com/news/video-why-balanced-suspension-is-so-important.html,Video: Why Balanced Suspension is So Important - Pinkbike,"Last week, Christina gave you her tips for setting up your fork and rear shock. Now she's back, and talking all about balancing the two."," Christina talks us through why balance is important, how provides some advice on how to achieve it.This video is presented by Ohlins Racing 

","Balanced suspension is so vital and yet is rarely discussed or talked about by many riders when setting up bikes. I help setup customers and some of our junior racer's suspension and man oh man I have seen some wild shit go down when analyzing trail behaviour on their bikes.I always hear ""the front feels this way"" and ""the rear feels this way"" but rarely do I hear a rider discuss how the two are feeling in tandem. The biggest one I see is the rocking horse affect in rougher section of trails or consecutive little drops in a trail type thing. Its a disaster for riders trying to sort out suspension if you don't have someone watching or filming sections of trail as its hard to see and or feel the affect while riding relative to how much you can learn watching yourself after riding the section.Doesn't matter if you have the best suspension, the mid-tiers or the base models... Your bikes suspension can provide a lot of performance if you take the time to sort out your suspension and try your best to get the most from it.Sometimes you cant even get started on better rider body position if you are just subconsciously trying to deal with your shit suspension setup all the time."

The U23 Men kicked off the day of racing as Carter Woods and Adrien Boichis kept the speeds high as they were unmatched at the front of the race. Adrien Boichis tried to topple Carter Woods in the final lap but after two failed attacks it was the Canadian rider who powered ahead to cross the line 15 seconds ahead. Next up was the U23 Women and once again Samara Maxwell delivered a dominant performance taking the lead in lap two and never looking back. Samara piloted her new Rocrider race bike to the top step of the podium with Ronja Blöchlinger crossing the line over a minute back. The top five riders were split by a huge four minutes and 19 seconds.Laura Stigger was unstoppable in Snowshoe as she created a six-second gap on lap two before riding away from the chasing group to secure her first World Cup XCO win. Laura Stigger rode a near-perfect race to master the tough course and stay ahead of challenges from the world's best. Loana Lecomte tried her best to close the gap with the margin shrinking to just 16 seconds at the mid-point on the final lap, but it would prove just too much as the French racer settled for 2nd place. Martina Berta was at the sharp end for all six laps as she wrapped up the penultimate round of the season in third.What a ride from Jordan Sarrou as he fended off attacks throughout the race before winning a final showdown against Nino Schurter to win in Snowshoe. Jordan Sarrou played a smart race as he remained close to the front allowing him to charge past Luca Schwarzbauer when he punctured on lap five.

Just before the semi-finals at the last round of the World Cup Dean Lucas hit a tree on the course after losing grip and ended up amongst a group of rocks. Initially, Dean says that he could not feel his arms and legs although after a few minutes feeling did return. Dean was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with a spinal hyperextension injury.We wish Dean all the best with his recovery and it is great to see him back walking and talking.Things went reaaal bad man. Qualifying day at the Snowshoe Downhill World Cup started positive, got real sketchy, real quick. Then turned into the biggest nightmare I have ever found myself in. I had a bad crash into a tree and stretched my spinal cord pretty decently. I lost all feeling to my whole body for a while there and it got pretty scary....I've been released from hospital now, and the plan is to make a plan. Then execute said plan to get home and recover.Big love to everyone that has helped me big or small. & all the support and messages. It means the world.— Dean LucasQualifying day at the 2023 Snowshoe Downhill World Cup! This track is rough and the rocks and roots can decide where you are going on your behalf.I was having trouble with a section in the morning and then ended up crashing in the same part of the track at the end of practice. This has been the most insane experience and I can't be more stoked and grateful to be walking and talking. I have never been so scared in my life, not being able to move my body at all caused my head to go all over the place thinking about different possibilities. I am keen to get home and get some rest, it's going to be a mission to fly back but Gary is coming with me and can help a brother out.  This is definitely not how I wanted to finish the season and my career but that's what we are dealing with this time!— Dean Lucas 

",So relieved to see these videos. I was on site of the crash. It was a very heavy and scary situation. Proud of the response by the Snowshoe patrol first responders.

I'm always scheming new project ideas, so I suggested he build a custom trail for us to film a project. He said he would inquire with the park but couldn't promise anything. Fast forward 12 months, after a couple strings pulled and some skilled trail builders hard at work, Clay Porter, Rupert Walker, Tyler Ravelle, and I found ourselves flying across the country with bikes, camera gear, and excitement to shoot the brand-new trail at VBN. Thank you to everyone involved in this project: VBN Trail Crew, Alexandra Power, Antoine Lebeau, Alexandre Verret, Frédéric Asselin, Gabriel Gakwaya, Jade Demers, Jon Gregory, Austin Davignon, and Lawrence Reti, to name a few. ""From trail building to cinematography, every person who worked on this project is a master at their work, which was inspiring on many levels. This was my first project of the 2023 season, and I couldn't have asked for a better crew. The dirt at VBN is incredible, and the conditions were perfect. I can't thank everyone enough who made this project come to life."" - Brett Rheeder. ""Evergreen was a dream project through and through. Insane build. Insane rider. Insane crew. If every project I worked on had Evergreen's ingredients, I would be living my nirvana as an artist. Evergreen is the dream realized and actualized."" - Clay Porter. ""I was so surprised with my experience shooting in Quebec and specifically VBN. The lush green forests, rolling mountains and perfectly made trails were a photographer's dream. Coming from the West Coast, I had no idea Quebec held so much hidden beauty."" - Tyler Ravelle. ""Working with Brett, Clay and Tyler on this was such an inspiring experience. I'm really proud of what the crew created. The vibes were high, and the boys were firing! Brett's riding mixed with Clay's directing is a special combination!"" - Rupert Walker.

The IWO's purpose is to ignite a spirit of empowerment, resilience, and connection among Indigenous women by providing them with the opportunity to explore and excel in outdoor sport activities. ""The Seventh Generation Principle is an indigenous concept originating from the Haudenosaunee (also known as the Iroquois Confederacy), in which you think about the next seven generations coming after you in your words, work, and actions; and to remember the seven generations who came before you. We are not racing for us; we are challenging ourselves to lead our youth for the next seven generations.” - Indigenous Women Outdoors.

The whitewash of these monstrous waves comes in with blood, sweat, and broken bike parts, yet it spreads something completely different across the sand that remains: inspiration to the masses. Why does Freeride strike the hearts of so many mountain bikers? It’s more than just a niche discipline of cycling, it’s been a movement – a form of rebellion. For Kona Factory Rider Kyleigh Stewart, this movement shaped her upbringing almost entirely. Born and raised in Kamloops BC, it was just part of the norm to encourage a young shredder to hit jumps in the yard. As her local riding community dove deeper into jumps and creative lines, her progression as a rider evolved in variety, style, and impressive features – just like the famous local trails.Tomomi Nishikubo - Mexico Magic: Discover incredible bike tricks performed by talented Japanese trials athlete, Tomomi Nishikubo, at the famous Edward James Sculpture Garden, Las Pozas in Xilitla, Mexico.

Building a good set of trails takes time, effort, and more importantly, love for the craft. As the trail season closes out for Jon Tinsley’s local trails, he took the opportunity to get some early morning sessions in with Chris Flook, Kurt Perkins, Nick Mondella, and Cody Gessel. Hit play and catch some moments of zen in Utahpia. “As hot summer days begin fade and seasonal storms ramp up, we’re quickly reminded how fleeting the riding season can be. Utahpia is an ode to the hidden art of trail building, and serves a reminder of how early mornings at the trails can often feel quite mystical. Not long from now, tarps will be set for the winter and we’ll be wishing it was summer once again.” - Jon Tinsley.

The film was groundbreaking at the time for its innovative use of editing and music, which helped create a unique and immersive viewing experience for skateboarders and fans alike. Muska played a significant role in the making of the film, not only as one of the featured skateboarders but also as a creative force behind the scenes. He collaborated with the film's director, Tim Dowling, on the film's soundtrack and helped choose the music that would accompany the skateboarding footage. Shorty's Fulfill the Dream became an instant classic and has since been praised as one of the best skate movies of all time. Whether it's through skateboarding or film, Muska's influence on the culture of skateboarding remains as strong as ever.Andy Anderson - Cold Call: Visiting Venice's landmark spots, Andy links his inspirations from Natas to TA and Rodney, with a freestyle session to boot.

","What an incredible weekend. Awesome racing, great vibe to the whole thing.I’ve been following professional mountain biking since the 1990s and this was my first time ever attending a World Cup event. The riders were so accessible and engaging. Andres Kolb let my seven year old play with his bike and showed her around the pits. Wyn Masters is just like you’d expect him to be. I was really impressed with all the riders we met. Plus I met Missy Giove and had a beer with her, so that was pretty awesome."
